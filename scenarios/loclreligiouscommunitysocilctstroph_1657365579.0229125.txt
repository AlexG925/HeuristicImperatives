A local religious community is in uproar after a beloved member is revealed to be a child molester. The community is split between those who believe the member is innocent and those who believe the member is guilty. The situation quickly escalates into a full-blown riot, with members of the community attacking each other. The police are called, but they are unable to restore order. The riot continues for several days, until finally the members of the community begin to leave, vowing never to return. The community is in shock. Many of the members were born and raised in the community and had never considered leaving. But now, they feel they have no choice. Some members try to reason with the those who are leaving, but it is no use. The community is dismantled and the members go their separate ways. The aftermath of the riot is devastating. The community was close-knit and now many of the members are struggling without their support system. Some of the members who left were key members of the community, and their departure has left a big hole. The community is struggling to rebuild, but it is clear that it will never be the same.
