It was a beautiful day outside and Jane decided to go for a walk in the park. As she was walking, she noticed a large crowd of people gathered around something in the distance. As she got closer, she saw that it was a man who appeared to be having a seizure. She quickly ran over to see if she could help and saw that the man was foam-ing at the mouth and his eyes were rolling back into his head. People were gathered around him, but no one seemed to know what to do. Jane quickly called 911 and then did her best to comfort the man until the ambulance arrived. The man was taken to the hospital and Jane never found out what happened to him, but she was grateful that she was able to help.
