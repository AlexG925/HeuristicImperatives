A new year brings a new age of tension to the world as old grudges and disputes flare up anew. This time, it's not just isolated skirmishes or small-scale fighting. This time, it's all-out war. The major superpowers of the world throw their weight behind their respective allies, and soon the entire globe is engulfed in conflict. The fighting is fierce and brutal, with no quarter given. Millions die in the fighting, and entire cities are reduced to rubble. The situation remains unresolved, with neither side able to gain a decisive advantage. The war drags on, day after day, month after month, with no end in sight. The toll on both sides is tremendous, and the world is left a shadow of its former self.
