In the early hours of the morning, a strange disturbance began rocking the planet. It was a low, vibrating hum that seemed to come from deep within the earth itself. It was strong enough to wake people from their sleep, and as it grew louder, it became clear that it was coming from everywhere at once. No one could figure out what was causing the strange noise, but it quickly became clear that it was affecting everything on the planet. Technology began malfunctioning, animals began acting strangely, and the very air seemed to be charged with electricity. The disturbance went on for hours, until finally it abruptly stopped. The world was left in a state of confusion and shock. No one could explain what had happened, but the effects were evident. The world had changed, and it would never be the same again.
