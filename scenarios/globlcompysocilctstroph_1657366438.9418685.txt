It's been one year since the outbreak of a pandemic that has decimated the global population. The few remaining survivors are scattered across the globe, fighting for their lives in a world that has gone mad. One of the largest companies in the world, ABC Corporation, was one of the first to be hit. Within days, its employees were dying in droves, its offices were deserted, and its factories were left to rot. Now, one year later, ABC Corporation is a shell of its former self. Its employees are gone, its products are gone, and its once-mighty empire has crumbled. But the company is not dead yet. A small team of survivors has banded together in an attempt to keep the company alive. They're working out of a secret location, using whatever resources they can find to keep the company going. They're fighting an uphill battle, but they're determined to keep the company alive. They know that if they can just hang on for a few more years, the world will start to rebuild and their company will be there to lead the way.
