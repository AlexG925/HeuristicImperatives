As the sun began to set on another day, the people of the world began to stir. In the nation of A, people were preparing for their weekly commotion. The commotion was a moderate one, but it always left the nation on edge. In the nation of B, people were preparing for their own weekly commotion. This commotion was also moderate, but it always left the nation feeling uneasy. Both nations had been at peace for years, but the weekly commotions always threatened to break that peace. One night, as the people of A were preparing for their weekly commotion, they heard a loud noise coming from the nation of B. It sounded like a battle was taking place. The people of A were immediately on edge, and they knew that the peace between the two nations was about to be broken. The people of A rushed to the border between the two nations, and they could see that the people of B were under attack from a third nation. The people of A knew that they had to help the people of B, but they were also afraid of getting involved in the conflict. The people of A called out to the people of B, offering their help. The people of B were hesitant at first, but they eventually agreed to let the people of A help them. The two nations fought together against the third nation, and they were able to drive them back. The people of A and B were relieved, but they were also worried that the peace between their nations would not last.
