The local religious community is up in arms about a new city ordinance. The ordinance, passed by the city council, requires all businesses to close on Sundays. This, of course, affects the religious community the most, as they are the ones who rely on Sundays for their religious services. The city council argues that the ordinance is necessary in order to give people a day of rest and to promote family values. The religious community, on the other hand, argues that the ordinance is a violation of their religious freedom. The situation remains unresolved, and the two sides are at a impasse.
