A severe pandemic suddenly and unexpectedly sweeps through the global population, killing billions of people within months. The few remaining survivors are left scrambling to understand what has happened and how to survive in a world where the majority of humanity has been wiped out. One family is caught in the midst of this pandemonium. They are forced to watch as friends and loved ones succumb to the disease, leaving them feeling isolated and alone. As the days go on, they grow increasingly desperate, wondering if they will be next. They huddle together in their home, rationing what little food and water they have left, desperately hoping for some respite from the nightmare that has become their reality. But there is none to be found. The pandemic shows no signs of slowing down, and with each passing day, the family grows more and more hopeless.
