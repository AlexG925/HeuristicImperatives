Mildred and Harold had been married for fifty years. They were the envy of their friends and family - a couple who had always seemed to be so in love. But, in recent years, things had changed. They had grown apart, and now barely spoke to one another. It was as if they were living in separate worlds. One day, Mildred came home from running errands to find Harold sitting in the living room, watching television. She asked him how his day had been, but he barely acknowledged her and simply grumbled in response. Mildred sighed and went into the kitchen, where she began to make dinner. As she cooked, she couldn't help but think about all the good times they had shared over the years. She remembered the first time Harold had kissed her, and the day they got married. Now, it seemed as if those memories were nothing but distant memories. She finished making dinner and called Harold into the kitchen. They ate in silence, and then went to their separate bedrooms. As Mildred lay in bed, she couldn't help but wonder what had happened to the love they once shared.
