The Johnson family live in a small house on the edge of a quiet town. Their backyard backs up to a huge forest, and beyond that is a mountain. The town is so small that there is only one school, and it goes up to eighth grade. Mr. and Mrs. Johnson both work, so their kids, Karen and Tim, are often left to their own devices. This is usually fine, as they are both well-behaved and responsible children. However, lately they've been hearing strange noises coming from the forest. Sometimes it sounds like someone crying, and other times it sounds like something big and heavy is moving around. They've told their parents about it, but they just say that it's probably just the wind. Karen and Tim are starting to get scared, and they don't know what to do.
