The citizens of the town are in an uproar. The mayor has been caught taking bribes from the local businesses in exchange for favors. The town council is split on what to do about it. Half of them want to impeach the mayor and the other half want to give him a chance to explain himself. The townspeople are divided as well. Some believe that the mayor is a crook and should be removed from office, while others think that he is a good man who made a mistake. They are all waiting to see what the town council will do.
