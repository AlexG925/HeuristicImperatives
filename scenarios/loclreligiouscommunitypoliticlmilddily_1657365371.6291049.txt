The town of Havenwood is home to a small but devout religious community. The townspeople are constantly at odds with one another over the slightest things, and the peaceful resolution of these disputes is always just out of reach. The latest disagreement is over the new minister, Reverend James. The town's previous minister, Reverend Thomas, was a kind and gentle man who everyone could agree on. But Reverend James is a firebrand preacher who is always stirring up trouble. On one side of the argument are those who believe that Reverend James is exactly what the town needs. They say that he isn't afraid to speak his mind, and that he isn't afraid to stand up for what he believes in. On the other side are those who believe that Reverend James is nothing but trouble. They say that he is always causing arguments and that he is never going to let the town come to a peaceful resolution. No matter which side of the argument you are on, one thing is for sure: the town of Havenwood is in for a long and difficult battle.
