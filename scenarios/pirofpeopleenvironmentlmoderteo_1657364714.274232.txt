A young married couple, both in their early twenties, found themselves in the midst of a heated argument. It started with a simple disagreement over whose turn it was to do the dishes, but quickly escalated into a full-blown shouting match. The wife, feeling overwhelmed and frustrated, threw a dish towel at her husband and stormed out of the kitchen. She went to their bedroom and slammed the door, leaving her husband standing in the kitchen alone and angry. The husband, still fuming, decided to take a walk to cool down. He told himself he wasn't going to go back into the house until he'd calmed down and could apologize to his wife. But as he walked down the street, he began to notice that things looked different. His neighborhood - which had always been a quiet, peaceful place - was now full of trash and graffiti. Cars were abandoned in the middle of the street, and there was a strange smell in the air. As he walked, the husband began to see people walking around in a daze, muttering to themselves. He started to feel uneasy, and hurried back to his house. When he got there, he found that his wife was gone. He called out for her, but there was no answer. He searched the house, but she was nowhere to be found. The husband finally gave up and sat down in the living room, trying to figure out what was going on. It was then that he realized he could hear a faint voice coming from the television. He turned it on and saw that the entire world was in chaos. People were rioting in the streets, and the city was in flames. The husband sat in disbelief, watching as the world he knew crumbled around him. His wife was gone, and he had no idea where she was or what had happened to her. All he could do was sit and watch as the world fell apart.
