John had always been a bit of a loner. He preferred the company of books to people, and he never really felt like he fit in anywhere. So when the pandemic hit, he didn't think it would be that big of a deal. He could just hole up in his apartment with his cats and ride it out. But as the days stretched into weeks, and the weeks into months, John started to go stir-crazy. He wasn't used to being around people all the time, and the constant news reports of the death and destruction were taking their toll. One day, John snapped. He grabbed a kitchen knife and went out into the streets, stabbing anyone he came across. He didn't know why he was doing it, he just felt like he had to. The police quickly caught up to him and he was thrown in prison. John spends the rest of his days behind bars, haunted by the memories of the people he killed.
