No one knows what to do. Some people try to ignore it and go about their lives as normal, but it is hard to ignore the feeling that something is wrong.Others try to find out what is causing the feeling, but no one has been able to figure it out. There are theories, of course, but nothing concrete. The unease and anxiety continue to build, until one day, something does happen. What, no one knows.
