John, a 38-year-old accountant, was having a typical workweek. He woke up early on Monday morning, got ready for work, and kissed his wife goodbye. He arrived at his office, sat down at his desk, and began working on his reports. As he was working, he received a call from his wife. She told him that she had been in a car accident and was taken to the hospital. John immediately left work and rushed to the hospital. His wife was in the ER, and she told him that she was rear-ended by a truck while she was stopped at a red light. She was in a lot of pain, but the doctors said she would be okay. John was relieved, but he was also worried about the financial impact of the accident. He knew they had good insurance, but he also knew that accidents could be very expensive. He stayed at the hospital with his wife until she was discharged, and then he took her home. John stayed home with his wife on Tuesday to help her recover from the accident. On Wednesday, he went back to work, but he was still worried about the financial impact of the accident.
