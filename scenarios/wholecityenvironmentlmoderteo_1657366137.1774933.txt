A whole city is in uproar after a spate of mysterious disappearances. For the past month, people have been vanishing without a trace and the bodies of those who have been found have shown no signs of violence. The disappearances have been random, with no pattern or rhyme or reason to them, and the police are baffled. The city is on edge, with people afraid to leave their homes after dark and parents afraid to let their children out of their sight. The disappearances have caused panic and paranoia to spread like wildfire, and the city is a shadow of its former self.
