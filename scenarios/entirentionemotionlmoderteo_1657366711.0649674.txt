The Federation is a nation of supernatural creatures who have been living peacefully for centuries. However, every full moon, the creatures transform into their feral forms and go on a rampage, destroying everything in sight. The only way to stop them is to kill them. The military has tried everything to stop the creatures, but nothing has worked. The people of the Federation are living in fear, not knowing when the next full moon will be or what will happen to their loved ones.
