At Global Corporation, the mild daily hubbub is a constant source of stress for employees. Many feel that they are constantly on the verge of being laid off, and the company's reputation for being environmentally friendly is a joke. The company's offices are filled with paper and plastic waste, and the company's factories are belching black smoke into the air. In addition, the company's products are often shipped in packaging that is not recyclable. Employees are tired of feeling like they are working for a polluting, heartless corporation, and are beginning to organize to demand change. Management is aware of the problem, but is reluctant to make any major changes that could impact the bottom line. The situation remains unresolved.
