An entire nation is devastated by a large earthquake. The shaking lasts for several minutes, and when it finally subsides, the damage is extensive. Buildings have collapsed, roads have been buckled and broken, and power lines are down. The quake has also triggered landslides in many areas, making travel and rescue efforts even more difficult. In the aftermath of the disaster, the nation is in shock. Thousands of people are dead or missing, and countless more have been left homeless. Search and rescue teams are working around the clock to try to find survivors, but the extent of the damage makes their task daunting. With aftershocks still occurring and the risk of further landslides, it will be many days before the full extent of the damage is known.
