A strange sense of foreboding hung in the air, as if something terrible was about to happen. As the day wore on, the unease grew stronger. By midday, panic had started to set in. People were running through the streets, screaming and shouting. No one knew what was happening, but everyone could sense that something was very wrong. The city was in chaos. Within hours, it had descended into complete pandemonium. Buildings were burning, people were fighting and looting, and there was a general feeling of terror and despair. No one knew what had caused this sudden change, but the city was in a state of emergency.
