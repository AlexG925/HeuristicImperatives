A severe storm unlike any seen before hits the earth. Winds reach speeds of over 200 miles per hour, and the rain is so dense that it feels like needles hitting the skin. The storm lasts for days, causing widespread damage and flooding. Cities are inundated, houses are destroyed, and people are stranded. The storm is so severe that it causes the earth's rotation to slow down, throwing off the planet's climate and causing extreme weather conditions around the world. The storm finally ends, but the damage it has caused is unfathomable. The world is left in chaos, and the future is uncertain.
