Theories about what the light could be ranged from a UFO to a natural phenomenon, but no one could say for sure. The light appeared sporadically for a few months, always causing a stir. Finally, a group of scientists discovered that the light was actually a rare comet that was only visible from Earth every few hundred years. Although the mystery was solved, the comet continued to be a source of fascination and fear for many people.
