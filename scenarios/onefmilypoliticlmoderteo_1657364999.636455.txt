Living in the city of New York, they are constantly on edge, never knowing when the next disturbance will hit. The Smiths have learned to adapt to this new reality, but it is not easy. They often have to take refuge in their home, huddled together in the basement until the tumult subsides. The children are often scared and askQuestions about what is happening, but their parents do their best to answer them. The Smiths hope that one day the world willreturn to some semblance of normalcy, but for now, they have to make do with what they have. They are a family that sticks together, no matter what.
