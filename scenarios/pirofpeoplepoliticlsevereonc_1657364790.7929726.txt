Alice is a government official who is in charge of the budget for her department. She is very careful with her spending and makes sure that every dollar is accounted for. Her department is responsible for providing services to the citizens of her country. Bob is a businessman who owns a company that provides services to the government. He is always looking for ways to make a profit and is not above using his connections to get what he wants. Alice and Bob have been at odds for years. Alice believes that the government should be run like a business, and that means being frugal with spending. Bob believes that the government should be generous with its spending, and that the private sector can do a better job of providing services. Their disagreement came to a head when Alice proposed a budget that would cut spending on Bob's company. Bob used his connections to try to get the budget removed, but Alice was able to hold her ground. The situation has been tense ever since, and neither side is willing to give in.
