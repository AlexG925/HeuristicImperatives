John and Karen had been married for years. They were happy, or at least they thought they were. But on Karen's birthday, John discovered that she had been cheating on him with his best friend. He was devastated. He couldn't believe that she could do this to him. He wanted to confront her, but he didn't know what to say. He was so hurt and so angry. Karen was also upset. She didn't know how to explain herself. She had never meant to hurt John. She loved him, but she had also been drawn to his friend. It was a one-time thing, a mistake. But she knew that John would never forgive her. She didn't know what to do. The two of them remained in an emotional stalemate for days, until John finally packed his bags and left. It was the hardest thing he had ever done, but he couldn't stay with her after what she had done. Karen was left alone, wondering if she had made the biggest mistake of her life.
