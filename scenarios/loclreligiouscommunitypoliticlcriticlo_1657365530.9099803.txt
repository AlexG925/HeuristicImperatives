In the small town of Shepherdstown, the local religious community is in turmoil. The annual conference of the United Church of Christ is being held, and the town's residents are split on whether or not to allow the event to take place. Some believe that the conference will bring much-needed publicity and money to the town, while others believe that it will only serve to further divide the community. The situation remains unresolved, and the town is on the brink of civil war.
