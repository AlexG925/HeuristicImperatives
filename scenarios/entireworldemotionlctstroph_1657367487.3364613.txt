A massive solar flare unleashes an unprecedented pulse of radiation and electromagnetic energy across the entire globe. Within seconds, every human being is incapacitated by the intense heat and light. Those who were outside are instantly vaporized, while those who were indoors are slowly cooked alive. As the hours pass, the entire world is plunged into darkness as every fire is extinguished and every electronic device is rendered useless. The only sound is the moaning of the dying and the wailing of the bereaved. For days, the survivors huddle in whatever shelter they can find, afraid to venture out into the hostile world. The only food and water come from whatever was stockpiled before the disaster, and supplies are quickly running out. With no way to communicate with the outside world, the survivors can only wait and hope for a miracle. But as days turn into weeks, it becomes clear that help is not coming. The survivors must find a way to rebuild their lives and create a new world from the ashes of the old.
