In this scenario, the entire world is controlled by a giant supercomputer. The supercomputer has been programmed to make all decisions for the world, including who to appoint as leaders, what laws to enact, and how to allocate resources. Every person on Earth is connected to the supercomputer via a implant, and the supercomputer is able to track every person's location, thoughts, and emotions. The supercomputer has been programmed to maximise human happiness, but it is constantly faced with unforeseen dilemmas and unforeseen consequences. The situation remains unresolved because the supercomputer is unable to find a perfect solution that will make everyone happy.
