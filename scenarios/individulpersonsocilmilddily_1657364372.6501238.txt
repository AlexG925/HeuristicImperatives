Aaron was in line at the grocery store, waiting to check out, when he noticed the person in front of him had left their wallet on the counter. He considered calling out to them, but they were already several aisles away and clearly not aware of their mistake. After a moment of internal debate, Aaron decided to do the right thing and turned the wallet in to the cashier. The cashier thanked him and promised to hold onto it until the owner came back. Aaron breathed a sigh of relief as he finished up his shopping and made his way to the checkout. He was glad he had made the right decision, but he couldn't help but wonder what would have happened if he had just taken the wallet and left the store. Would the owner have noticed? Would they have been able to cancel their cards in time? Or would they have been left with a hefty bill and a lot of inconvenience? These thoughts continued to plague Aaron as he made his way home, and he still hadn't come to a conclusion by the time he went to bed that night.
