A pandemic of a new virus dubbed "The Sweeper" has quickly spread across the globe, killing billions in its wake. The virus is airborne and kills within hours of infection. The only way to prevent its spread is through complete isolation - no one can leave their homes, no one can enter another person's home, no one can go outside. The entire world is effectively on lockdown. The virus has thrown the world into chaos. Global economies have collapsed, social structures have broken down, and traditional forms of government are no longer effective. The few surviving humans are fighting for their lives, trying to find a way to survive in a world that has become a hostile wasteland. The future is uncertain. Will the human race be able to find a way to survive? Or will this be the end of the world as we know it?
