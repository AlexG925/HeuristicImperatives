The company has been hit by a ransomware attack and all of their data has been encrypted. The attackers are demanding a ransom in order to decrypt the data and return it to the company. The company is trying to decide whether or not to pay the ransom, as they are not sure if the attackers will actually decrypt the data once the ransom is paid. The company is also considering trying to decrypt the data themselves, but they are not sure if they will be able to successfully do so.
