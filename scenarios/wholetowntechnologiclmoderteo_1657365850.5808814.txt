The town was in an uproar. It had been happening for weeks, ever since the new power plant had started up. Every Wednesday, at precisely 3:00 pm, a loud screeching noise would fill the air, followed by a series of explosions. The townspeople had no idea what was causing it, but they knew it had something to do with the power plant. The town council had called a meeting to try to figure out what to do, but no one could come up with a solution. The power plant was the only source of income for the town, and if it closed down, the town would be in trouble. So, for now, the townspeople just had to put up with the noise and hope that someone would figure out what was causing it and how to fix it.
