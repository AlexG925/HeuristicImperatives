A severe drought has hit the state of California. People are leaving the state in droves, searching for places with more water. The once-lush land is now a parched wasteland. The few remaining people are fighting over the last drops of water. There is no food, and the heat is unbearable. People are desperate and they will do anything to survive. The state government is in disarray. The governor has declared a state of emergency, but there is no relief in sight. The National Guard has been called in to maintain order, but they are quickly overwhelmed. People are looting, attacking each other, and committing suicide. The few remaining law enforcement officers are doing their best to keep the peace, but it is a losing battle. The situation is hopeless. The state of California is a catastrophe.
