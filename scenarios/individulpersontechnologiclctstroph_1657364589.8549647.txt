When the bombs dropped, everyone panicked. The initial blast radius was small, but the radiation was enough to kill everyone within a few miles. The government told everyone to stay indoors and wait it out, but the people were too scared. They were scared of the bombs, of the radiation, and of the government. They were scared of the future. The devastation was widespread. The bombs had hit major cities all over the world, and the radiation was spreading. The world was plunged into darkness, and the only sound was the sound of people screaming. The surviving humans banded together, but they were too late. The radiation had already mutated them, and they were now something else. Something inhuman. They were no longer people, but monsters. The world was now a playground for the monsters, and the humans were their prey.
