The deadline for the ransom has come and gone, and the hackers have made good on their threat, leaving the city in disarray. Emergency services are overwhelmed, traffic lights are dark, and businesses are struggling to cope. The mayor has called in the National Guard to help restore order, but it will be weeks before the city is back to normal.
