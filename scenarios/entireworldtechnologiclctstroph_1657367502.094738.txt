The year is 20xx. It's been a century since the last major global pandemic â€“ a pandemic that wiped out nearly a third of the world's population. Now, another one is brewing. This time, it's far more virulent and contagious, with a mortality rate of nearly 100%. Within weeks of the first case being reported, it has spread to every corner of the globe. Hospitals are overrun, schools and businesses are shuttered, and entire countries are in lockdown. The world is in panic. No one knows where it came from, or how to stop it. The best and brightest minds are working around the clock to find a vaccine or cure, but so far, they've been unsuccessful. The death toll continues to rise, with no end in sight. The situation is bleak, and the future looks grim.
