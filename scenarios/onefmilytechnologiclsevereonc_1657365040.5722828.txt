It was a calm autumn evening. The family was gathered around the dinner table, laughing and chatting. Suddenly, the power went out. The lights went out. The TV went off. In the darkness, they could hear the sound of breaking glass. The family huddled together, afraid of what was happening. They heard footsteps outside.Someone was coming towards the house. The family members all hid in different rooms, waiting for the intruder to pass. But the intruder didn't pass. They could hear them coming closer, opening doors, walking through the house. Then they heard the sound of footsteps on the stairs. The intruder was coming for them. The family members all hid under the beds, waiting for the intruder to pass. But the intruder didn't pass. They could hear them coming closer, opening doors, walking through the house. Then they heard the sound of footsteps on the stairs. The intruder was coming for them. The family waited in silence, afraid to make a sound. Suddenly, the intruder was in the room. They could hear them breathing. Then, without warning, the intruder attacked. The family members were all killed, one by one. The next morning, the house was silent. The family was dead. And the intruder was gone.
