A young woman is walking through the mall, looking at her phone and texting as she goes. She doesn't notice the group of teenagers following her until they start pushing her and yelling at her. The woman falls to the ground and the teenagers start kicking her and taking her phone. A security guard sees what's happening and runs over to try to stop the attack, but the teenagers run away before he can reach them. The woman is left lying on the ground, with a few cuts and bruises. Her phone is gone. The woman gets up and dusts herself off, then goes to the security guard to report the incident. She is visibly shaken and upset. The guard takes down her information and tells her that he will call the police. The woman thanks the guard and then leaves the mall, wondering if she should have just handed over her phone when the teenagers demanded it. The woman is just one of many people who have been attacked and robbed in the mall over the past few months. There have been several similar incidents, all of them involving groups of teenagers. The police have been investigating the attacks, but so far they haven't been able to identify the suspects. The mall has beefed up security in response to the attacks, but so far it hasn't made much difference.
