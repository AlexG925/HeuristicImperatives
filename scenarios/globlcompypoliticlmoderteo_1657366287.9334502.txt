In the wake of the global pandemic, many companies have been forced to shutter their doors. One such company is Global Corp, a multinational conglomerate with interests in a variety of industries. For the past several weeks, Global Corp has been the target of protests by employees of its various subsidiaries. The protesters allege that the company is putting profits before people, and that it is not doing enough to protect its workers from the pandemic. The protests have been ongoing for several weeks, and have occasionally turned violent. The company has so far been unable to resolve the situation, and it remains to be seen how long the protests will continue.
