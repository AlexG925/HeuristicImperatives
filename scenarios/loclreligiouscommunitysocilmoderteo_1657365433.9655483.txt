The local religious community is in an uproar over the announcement of a new bishop. Some members of the community feel that the new bishop is too liberal and does not adhere to the traditional values of the religion. Others believe that the new bishop is a breath of fresh air and will help to bring the community into the 21st century. The situation is further complicated by the fact that the new bishop was not elected by the community, but appointed by the church hierarchy. This has caused a rift within the community, with some members feeling that their voices have not been heard. The situation remains unresolved, with the community divided on whether the new bishop will be good for the community or not.
