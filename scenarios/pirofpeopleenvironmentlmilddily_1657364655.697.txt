For the last several months, John and Karen had been living in close quarters. Karen was John's upstairs neighbor in the dilapidated old house they both rented from the same slumlord. The house had been divided up into too many tiny apartments and was in a state of disrepair, but it was all they could afford. With the little money they had, they tried to make the best of the situation. The two of them had become friends, helping each other out when they could. They would borrow each other's things, share meals, and watch out for one another. But as the months wore on, the cracks in their friendship began to show. They started to get on each other's nerves, and little things that they had once found endearing began to annoy them. The final straw came one day when John came home to find Karen rummaging through his things. He had come home early from work because he was feeling sick, and he wasn't in the mood to deal with her. They got into a huge argument, and Karen ended up moving out the next day. They haven't spoken since, but the tension between them is still palpable.
