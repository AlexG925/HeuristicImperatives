The Johnson family is your typical middle-class American family. They have two kids, a stay-at-home mom, and a working dad. They live in a modest home in the suburbs and have a few close friends. They are comfortable, but not wealthy. One evening, after the kids are in bed and the dishes are done, the parents sit down to pay the bills. As they go through the stack, they realize that they are short on cash. They had planned to use their credit card to pay for a few upcoming expenses, but with the current balance, they would be over their limit. The parents start to brainstorm ways to come up with the extra cash. They could ask family or friends for a loan, but they hate to do that. They could sell some of their possessions, but they don't really have anything of value that they're willing to part with. They could get a part-time job, but with their current schedules, that would be difficult. After a long discussion, the parents decide to stop using their credit card and to start looking for a part-time job. They know it won't be easy, but they're determined to find a way to make ends meet.
