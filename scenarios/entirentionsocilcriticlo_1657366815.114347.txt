The citizens of the nation were in uproar. The government had made a critical mistake and the people were not going to stand for it. For years they had been living under the rule of a dictatorship, but this was the final straw. The people demanded change and they were not going to take no for an answer. The military was called in to quell the uprising, but they were met with stiff resistance. The people were not going to go down without a fight and they quickly began to organize themselves. The resistance grew stronger each day and soon the entire nation was in a state of anarchy. There was no clear leader and no clear objective, but the people were united in their desire for change. The situation remained unresolved for months. The government was unable to regain control and the people were unwilling to back down. It was a standoff with no end in sight. The people were exhausted but they were not ready to give up. They had tasted freedom and they were not going to go back to living under the rule of a dictatorship.
