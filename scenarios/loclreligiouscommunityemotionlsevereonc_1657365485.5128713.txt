The Eastern Hills Christian Church had always been a small, but devout community. Every year, they would hold their annual church picnic on the Fourth of July. It was a time for the community to come together, share a meal, and enjoy each other's company. This year, however, things took a turn for the worse. As the picnic was getting underway, a group of protesters showed up, carrying signs and shouting slogans. They were angry at the church for being " exclusionary" and " judgmental." The church members tried to ignore them and went about their picnic, but the protesters would not be silenced. Things quickly escalated, and before long, a full-fledged arguments were taking place. The church members were devastated. This was supposed to be a time of peace and unity, and now it was being ruined by hatred and division. The situation was unresolved, and it seemed like the divide between the two groups was only getting wider.
