Edwin wakes up to another day. He rubs his eyes and silently curses the sun for being so cheerful. It's Monday morning, which means it's time for his weekly family breakfast. He silently trudges to the kitchen, where his wife and two kids are already seated. His wife, Lila, is chatting animatedly with their son, John. John is regaling her with a story about his weekend. Edwin can tell from the way Lila is laughing that she's not really listening. Edwin takes his seat and begins to eat his breakfast. He can feel the eyes of his daughter, Alice, on him. Alice is staring at him intently, as though she's waiting for him to say something. Edwin knows what she wants. She wants him to ask her about her weekend, to show an interest in her life. But he can't bring himself to do it. He's not interested in hearing about the stupid things she did with her friends. So he simply continues to eat his breakfast, pretending not to notice her. The family finishes their breakfast in silence. Edwin can feel the tension in the air. He knows that his wife and daughter are disappointed in him. But he doesn't care. He's not going to give them the satisfaction of asking about their weekends. Let them think he doesn't care. It's better than having to listen to their boring stories.
