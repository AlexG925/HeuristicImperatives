The city was in a panic. A severe storm was headed their way and it was going to be the worst they had seen in years. The Mayor called a citywide meeting to try and calm the citizens down, but it only made things worse. People were shouting and arguing, trying to figure out what to do. Some wanted to evacuate, others wanted to stay and ride it out. In the end, the Mayor made the decision to mandatory evacuate the city. The storm hit the city hard. The wind was so strong that it blew the roofs off of buildings, the rain was so heavy that it caused flash flooding, and the hail was so large that it smashed through windows. It was a disaster. The worst part was that it was all over the city. There was no safe place to go. People were trapped in their homes, dodging flying debris and waiting for the storm to pass. After what felt like hours, the storm finally started to die down. The sun came out and people started to emerge from their homes. The damage was everywhere. Cars were overturned, windows were shattered, and the street was covered in debris. It was a mess, but the city was alive. People were already starting to clean up the mess and rebuild. It would take time, but the city would rebound.
