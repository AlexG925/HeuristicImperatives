George is a 54 year old man who has been working as a computer programmer for the past 32 years. He's seen a lot of changes in the industry, but nothing has prepared him for the events of the past year. It all started with the rise of a new programming language that George had never heard of. Within a few months, it had completely replaced the language he had been using for his entire career. George quickly found himself struggling to keep up with the new language, and his skills rapidly became obsolete. In desperation, George turned to online courses and forums to try and teach himself the new language. But it was no use; he simply couldn't keep up with the pace of change. Within a few months, he was unemployed, and his savings were quickly running out. George was forced to move into his son's basement, and his life rapidly became a downward spiral. He spends his days browsing the internet, trying to find anything that can help him learn the new programming language and get his life back on track. But it seems hopeless; he's too old and too far behind. The industry has left him behind, and George doesn't know what to do.
