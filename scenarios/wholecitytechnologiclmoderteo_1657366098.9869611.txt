For years the City had been plagued by a strange phenomenon; every Monday morning at precisely 9:00 am, a deep rumbling would shake the entire city, accompanied by a loud, screeching noise. No one knew what it was, but it quickly became known as the Monday Morning Shakedown. The shaking would last for several minutes, causing great inconvenience and even some damage, but it was always over by 9:15 am. No one could figure out where the noise was coming from, or why it only happened on Mondays. The Mayor had even offered a large sum of money to anyone who could solve the mystery, but so far, no one had been able to. On this particular Monday, the shaking was more violent than ever before, and the noise was so loud that it could be heard even over the din of the city. Windows were shattered, and cars were overturned. Finally, at 9:15 am, it stopped as suddenly as it had begun. But this time, there was something different. A strange, misty substance was now covering the city. It looked almost like fog, but it was different color. And it was slowly spreading across the city, getting thicker and thicker. People started to panic, not knowing what this substance was or what it could do to them. The Mayor quickly issued a state of emergency and ordered everyone to stay indoors. The city was quarantined, and no one was allowed in or out. The fog continued to spread, and within 24 hours, it had completely engulfed the city. The only sound now was the soft hum of the fog, and the occasional scream. No one knew what was happening, but they knew that whatever it was, it wasn't good.
