In the year 2155, the world is a very different place than it is today. For one, there are now multiple nations on Earth, each with their own government and way of life. The United Nations is still in place, but its power has diminished significantly over the years. The UN is now mainly concerned with solving disputes between the different nations, and its main base of operations is in Geneva, Switzerland. One of the largest issues the UN is currently dealing with is the escalating tension between the two nations of America and China. For the past few months, the two nations have been embroiled in a trade dispute, with each side accusing the other of unfair practices. The situation has been further complicated by the recent discovery of a new mineral that both nations are eager to get their hands on. The situation is currently at a standstill, with neither side willing to back down.
