In the midst of a critical once-in-a-decade upheaval, John Doe is left scrambling to figure out what to do. His entire life has been turned upside down and he doesn't know where to turn. The situation is further complicated by the fact that he doesn't have a lot of money saved up and he doesn't have any family or close friends to rely on. John Doe is a radiology technician at a hospital. He's been working there for the past 10 years and has been happy with his job. But now, with the hospital in the midst of a financial crisis, John is worried about his job security. He's already seen several of his colleagues get laid off and he knows that his position could be next. John has very little savings. He's been living paycheck to paycheck and has never really thought about what he would do in a situation like this. He's never been good with money and he's really starting to panic now. The only thing John can think to do is to try to get a loan from the bank. But he's not sure if he'll be able to get approved for a loan with his current financial situation. He's also not sure if taking out a loan is the right thing to do. He's getting more and more desperate as the days go on and he doesn't know what to do.
