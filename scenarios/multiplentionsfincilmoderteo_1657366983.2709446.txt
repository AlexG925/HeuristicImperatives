The United Nations is in a panic as reports of financial instability come in from multiple nations. Some nations are on the verge of economic collapse, while others are close to defaulting on their debt. The root cause of the problem is a disturbance that occurs once a month, which disrupts trade and commerce. As a result, many countries are struggling to keep their economies afloat. The situation is made worse by the fact that the UN is unable to agree on a course of action. Some nations are calling for immediate sanctions against the countries that are causing the most disruption, while others are calling for more expensive bailouts.
