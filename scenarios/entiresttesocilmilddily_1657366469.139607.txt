In the state of Vermont, there is a new law that has been passed stating that all citizens must wear a hat at all times when outdoors. The law was passed in an attempt to reduce the amount of UV radiation exposure that citizens are getting, as Vermont has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the country. However, the law has caused a lot of controversy, as many people feel that it is an infringement on their personal freedom. There have been a few protests against the law, but so far no one has been successful in getting it overturned.
