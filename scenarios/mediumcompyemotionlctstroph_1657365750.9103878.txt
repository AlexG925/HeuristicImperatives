The company is in the throes of a catastrophic once-in-a-century pandemonium. The situation remains unresolved. Panic and chaos reign as employees attempt to evacuate the premises. In the midst of the pandemonium, the CEO remains composed and issues a statement: "I assure you that we are doing everything in our power to resolve this situation as quickly and safely as possible. I thank you for your patience and cooperation." The statement does little to quell the panic, and employees continue to evacuate in a frenzy.
