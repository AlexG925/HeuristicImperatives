The small community of believers had always been a tight-knit group. They looked out for one another and supports each other through thick and thin. So, when the new religion started to spread through the town, they were skeptical. They didn't understand why their friends and neighbors were suddenly changing their ways and abandoning the community that had been so important to them. As the new religion continued to grow, the small community of believers found themselves increasingly isolated. They didn't know how to reach out to their friends and loved ones who had turned to this new way of life. The community started to feel like they were the only ones left who still believed in the old ways. One day, a group of the believers went to the local church to find that it had been taken over by the new religion. They were shocked and heartbroken to see that their sacred space had been taken away from them. They tried to reason with the new community, but they would not listen. The situation became heated and eventually turned violent. The small community of believers was forced out of the church and left to worship on their own.
