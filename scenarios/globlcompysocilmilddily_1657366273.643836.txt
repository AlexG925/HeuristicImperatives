It was a typical day at the headquarters of GlobalCo, a multinational corporation that operated in countries all over the world. employees milled about the open-plan office, chatting and laughing as they went about their work. Suddenly, the sound of a gunshot rang out, and everyone dropped to the floor. For a few moments, there was silence, then chaos as everyone scrambled to get out of the office. Panic-stricken employees pushed and shoved their way towards the exits, while others dove for cover under desks and tables. The shooter was nowhere to be seen, and it was unclear whether they had fled the scene or were still hiding somewhere in the office. With the building in lockdown and the police on their way, the employees were forced to wait and see what would happen next. Would the shooter be caught? Would they come back and continue their rampage? No one knew, but one thing was certain: it was going to be a long day at GlobalCo.
