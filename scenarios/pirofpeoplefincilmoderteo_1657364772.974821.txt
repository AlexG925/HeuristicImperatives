John and Karen have been married for 5 years. They have a 3-year-old son, and they both work full-time. Their financial situation is stable, but they live paycheck to paycheck. They don't have any savings, and they have a lot of credit card debt. Every month, they have to struggle to make ends meet. This month, they were hit with a unexpected expense. Their car broke down, and they had to pay $500 to get it fixed. They don't have the money, so they put it on their credit card. Now they're even more in debt, and they're not sure how they're going to make it through the month.
