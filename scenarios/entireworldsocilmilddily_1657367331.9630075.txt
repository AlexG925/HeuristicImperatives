John woke up to the sun bombarding his face. He lazily got out of bed, wondering what day it was. All days seemed to blend together lately. He walked to his window and looked out at the street below, seeing the people going about their business. He watched as a mother scolded her child for running into the street. A cat meowed loudly from a nearby tree. A dog barked in the distance. John sighed and turned away from the window. He made his way to the kitchen, where his wife was already up and making breakfast. They exchanged brief conversation as they went about their respective tasks. John ate his breakfast quickly, then grabbed his jacket and headed for the door. "I love you," his wife said as he stepped out. "Love you too," John replied, before closing the door behind him. John walked out into the streets and was enveloped by the noise and bustle of the city. He breathed in the fumes from the cars and the smell of garbage from the nearby alleyway. He watched as a group of teenagers walked by, laughing and joking with each other. A sense of longing filled him as he watched them. He shook his head and continued on his way.
