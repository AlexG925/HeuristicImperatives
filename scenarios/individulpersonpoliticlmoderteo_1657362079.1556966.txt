John was having a pretty good day. He'd gotten up early to get a head start on his work, and he was thrilled to have finally made some progress on his project. But then he heard the news: the president had been impeached. John was stunned. He couldn't believe it. He had voted for the president, and he had always thought he was doing a good job. But now it seemed like everything was unraveling. John didn't know what to think or what to do. He spent the rest of the day glued to the television, trying to make sense of it all. He saw the president give a press conference, watched as the stock market crashed, and listened to pundits debate what would happen next. It was all too much. John went to bed that night feeling shaken. He had always thought of himself as a political moderate, but now he wasn't so sure. It seemed like the country was heading for a major crisis, and he had no idea what to do about it.
