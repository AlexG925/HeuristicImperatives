The employees of a small company are gathered in the break room, waiting for the morning meeting to begin. The CEO enters, looking pale and shaken. "I have some bad news," she begins. "There has been a massive data breach. Personal information, company secrets, everything we have is now in the hands of our competitors." The employees gasp in shock and disbelief. The CEO continues. "I've been in touch with our IT department, and they are working around the clock to resolve the issue. But as of right now, we are in a very vulnerable position." The employees spend the rest of the meeting brainstorming ideas on how to mitigate the damage from the breach and how to prevent it from happening again in the future. But the situation is still unresolved, and the company remains in a very precarious position.
