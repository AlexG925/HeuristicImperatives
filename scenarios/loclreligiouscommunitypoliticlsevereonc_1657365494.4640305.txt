The small town of Shepherd's Hill is home to a close-knit community of devout Christians. Every year, on the night of the winter solstice, the town holds a celebration to mark the birth of Jesus Christ. The festivities always include a procession through the town square, and the raising of a cross in the town square. This year, however, the celebration takes a dark turn. A group of locals, claiming to be Pagans, interrupt the procession and begin to chant and dance around the cross. They mock the Christians and their beliefs, and claim that the winter solstice is a Pagan holiday, not a Christian one. The two groups face off against each other, shouting and jeering, but eventually the Pagans disperse and the Christians continue with their celebrations. However, the incident leaves the town feeling uneasy and divided. Some Christians feel that the Pagans are threatening their way of life, while some Pagans feel that the Christians are being intolerant of their beliefs. The situation remains unresolved, and it is unclear if the two groups will be able to come to a peaceful resolution.
