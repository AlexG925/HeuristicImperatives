A group of religious fanatics have taken over the small town of Shepherdstown, proclaiming it a safe haven from the impending Apocalypse. They have stockpiled food and supplies, and are armed to the teeth. The townspeople are terrified, and many have either fled or been locked up in the town's only church. The fanatics patrol the streets day and night, and anyone caught outside after dark is shot on sight. The town is a virtual war zone, and there is no end in sight.
