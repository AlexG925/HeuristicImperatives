The small town of Shepherdstown was a peaceful place - until the day the local religious community decided to build a new church. The church, which was to be built on the town's main street, caused a great deal of consternation among the townspeople. Some were worried that the church would bring unwanted attention to the town, while others were concerned about the impact the construction would have on traffic and noise levels. The town council met to discuss the issue, but no consensus could be reached. The situation remains unresolved, and the town is dividing into those who support the construction of the church and those who oppose it.
