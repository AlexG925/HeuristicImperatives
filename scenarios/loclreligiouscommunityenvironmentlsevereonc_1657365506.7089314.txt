From outside, the small town of Shepherdstown looks like any other Midwestern town. But on the inside, the residents are dealing with a very different reality. Every year, on the night of the winter solstice, a strange and powerful energy descends on the town, stirring up trouble among the residents. This has been going on for as long as anyone can remember, and no one knows how to stop it. The townsfolk have learned to stay indoors on that night, but even then they're not safe. The energy seems to target certain people, driving them to violence or madness. No one is sure why it happens, but it always leaves the town shaken and traumatized. This year, it's up to the town's new sheriff to try and keep the peace. But can he do it?
