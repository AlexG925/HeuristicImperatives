An entire nation is in upheaval. Once a month, on the night of the full moon, citizens transform into werewolves. No one knows why this happens, but it has always been this way. The government has tried to find a cure, but to no avail. The werewolves are generally peaceful, but when they are in their wolf form, they are uncontrollable. They have been known to attack and kill people, and destroy property. The government has set up a werewolf task force to try to deal with the situation, but it is proving to be difficult. The werewolves are not the only ones who are affected by this; the citizens are also afraid of them. Many people have started to leave the country, and the economy is suffering. The government is trying to keep a lid on the situation, but it is proving to be difficult.
