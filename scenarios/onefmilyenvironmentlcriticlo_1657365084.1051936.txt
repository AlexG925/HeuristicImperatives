(Paragraph 1) The Smith family had always been close-knit. But when they were forced to evacuate their home due to a natural disaster, they realized just how much they rely on one another. With their home and all of their belongings destroyed, they had to start over from scratch. But they were determined to rebuild their lives and their home together. (Paragraph 2) It's been a year since the disaster struck, and the Smith family is still living in a makeshift camp. They're tired, they're frustrated, and they're running out of hope. They've applied for every government assistance program possible, but they've been denied every time. They're not sure how much longer they can hold on. But they're determined to stick it out, together.
