The company's IT department is in the middle of a big project and they're up against a deadline. They're all feeling the pressure, but they're also feeling confident that they can get the job done. One of the employees, however, is starting to feel overwhelmed. The pressure is getting to her and she's doubting her ability to get the work done. Her mind is racing and she's finding it hard to focus. She takes a deep breath and tries to push her anxieties aside, but they keep creeping back up. She starts to feel panicky and she has to fight the urge to just give up and walk out of the office. The rest of the day is a struggle for her, but she manages to push through and get her work done. She's exhausted by the time she gets home, but she's also relieved that she made it through another day.
