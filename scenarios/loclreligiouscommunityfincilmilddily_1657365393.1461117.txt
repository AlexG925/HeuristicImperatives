The local religious community is up in arms about the new taxes that the city has imposed on them. The city claimed that the taxes are necessary to fund the new school that is being built in the community, but the religious leaders feel that they are being unfairly targeted. They have been in talks with the city for weeks, but so far no resolution has been reached. The community is starting to get impatient, and they are threatening to take their business elsewhere if the city doesn't give them a break.
