The Johnson family was sitting around their dinner table when they heard a loud crash outside. They all jumped up to see what had happened. Mr. Johnson saw a car had crashed into their fence and was sitting in their front yard. He rushed outside to see if the driver was okay. Mrs. Johnson and the children followed closely behind. The driver of the car was a young woman. She was bleeding from her head and was unconscious. Mr. Johnson called 911 and then tried to comfort the woman. Mrs. Johnson and the children stayed back, not knowing what to do. They all felt helpless as they watched the woman bleed. The ambulance arrived soon and the woman was taken to the hospital. The Johnson family was left feeling shaken. They were grateful that the woman was going to be okay, but they were also left with a lot of questions. Why did this happen? What could they have done differently? They may never know the answers to these questions, but they will never forget that night.
