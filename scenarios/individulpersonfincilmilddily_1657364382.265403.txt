At the end of a long day of work, John usually likes to relax with a beer and catch up on his favorite shows. But tonight, John is feeling especially stressed. He's been worrying about his mounting credit card debt and the stack of bills on his kitchen counter. John has always been good with money, but lately it seems like his expenses are always exceeding his income. He's tried cutting back on spending and even picked up a few extra shifts at work, but it doesn't seem to be enough. John is so preoccupied with his financial worries that he can't even enjoy his beer or relax in front of the television. He keeps going over his budget in his head, trying to figure out where he can cut back even more. He's already given up his gym membership and started bringing his lunch to work, but it doesn't seem to be helping. John is starting to feel desperate and he doesn't know what to do.
