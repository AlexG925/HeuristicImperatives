The local religious community is up in arms about a new city ordinance that requires all religious leaders to be licensed and registered with the city. They argue that this is a violation of their freedom of religion and that the city is infringing on their rights. The ordinance was enacted in response to a string of religious leaders who were caught engaging in fraud and other illegal activities. The community is divided on the issue, with some believing that the ordinance is necessary to protect their rights and others feeling that it is an invasion of their privacy. The situation remains unresolved.
