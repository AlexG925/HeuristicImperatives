The war began on a Tuesday. It was a quiet day, and the only sound was the rustling of the leaves in the gentle breeze. The first shot was fired without warning. It rang out across the world, echoing in the ears of everyone. In an instant, the peace was shattered. The war was fought on every continent, in every country. It was a war unlike any other the world had ever seen. The fighting was brutal, and there was no quarter given. The war lasted for years, and it seemed like there was no end in sight. Finally, after years of fighting, a peace treaty was signed. It was a tentative peace, and the world breathed a collective sigh of relief. But the peace was short-lived. Within a year, the war started again. The fighting was just as fierce as it had been before. And so it has continued, for years. The war ebbs and flows, but it never truly ends. The world is a battlefield, and the people are caught in the middle.
