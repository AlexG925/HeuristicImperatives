The entire continent was in an uproar. The once-a-week commotion had turned into a full-fledged riot, and nobody knew how to resolve the situation. The CONTINENTAL ARMY was called in to quell the riot, but they only made the situation worse. The CONTINENTAL NAVY was called in to assist, but they were unsuccessful as well. Finally, the CONTINENTAL AIR FORCE was called in to drop leaflets telling the rioters to disperse, but to no avail. The situation remains unresolved, and the continent is in a state of chaos.
