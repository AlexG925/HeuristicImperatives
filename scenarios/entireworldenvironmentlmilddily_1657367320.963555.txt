The sun rises over the horizon, casting a pink and orange hue over the world. The birds begin to sing and the squirrels chatter in the trees. All throughout the world, people are beginning their day. They stretch and yawn, brew their coffee, sit down at their desks, and begin their work. But something is different today. The sky is a bit darker than usual, the birds aren't singing as loudly, and the squirrels are silent. The people of the world can sense something is wrong, but they can't quite put their finger on it. As the day goes on, the darkness deepens and the air grows thick with tension. By noon, the sun has disappeared entirely and the world is plunged into darkness. Panic begins to set in as people realize that something is very wrong. The darkness lasts for days, weeks, months. The world is plunged into chaos as food and water supplies dwindle. People begin to turn on each other, fighting for the limited resources that remain. The situation remains unresolved. The darkness has not lifted and the people of the world are struggling to survive.
