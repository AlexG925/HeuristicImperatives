The fictional scenario is that a moderate disturbance happens at a medium company once a month. The situation is unresolved and the company is losing money. In order to make up for this, the company decides to increase prices on their products and services. However, this does not solve the underlying problem and causes customers to become disgruntled. The company is forced to make even more cuts to their budget, which eventually leads to layoffs and a decrease in morale.
