It was the year 20xx and the world was on the brink of a major technological upheaval. The old systems and technologies that had sustained the world for centuries were failing and the new systems and technologies that were supposed to take their place were not yet ready. The situation was made worse by the fact that the world was facing a once-in-a-decade upheaval. This was the first time that the world had ever faced such a situation and it was not clear how it would resolve itself. The family at the center of this scenario was the Smith family. They were a typical middle-class family who had been affected by the upheaval in a number of ways. The father, John, had lost his job as a result of the closure of the company he worked for. The mother, Jane, was struggling to keep the family afloat financially. The children, Sarah and Peter, were both struggling to cope with the changes in their lives. The family was struggling to keep their heads above water, but they were determined to make it through the upheaval.
