The United Nations is in shambles. Every year, on the anniversary of the signing of the UN Charter, member nations gather to discuss the world's problems. This year, however, the meeting degenerated into a yelling match, with each nation accusing the others of not doing enough to solve the world's problems. The situation remained unresolved, and the UN is now on the verge of collapse. If it does collapse, it is likely that the world will descend into chaos, with each nation going its own way and conflict erupting on a global scale.
