John and Karen were having a great day. They had just finished their last big project at work and were looking forward to a well-deserved vacation. However, when they got home, they found that their house had been severely damaged in a severe once-in-a-year uproar. The situation was unresolved and they were not sure what to do. After much discussion, they decided to take out a loan to repair the damage. However, the interest on the loan was high and they were not sure if they could afford it. They decided to consult with a financial advisor to see if they could get some help.
