It was the early hours of the morning when it started. At first, it was just a low rumble, like thunder in the distance. But within seconds, it was shaking the entire city. Buildings toppled, cars flipped over, and people were running in every direction, screaming in terror. The ground was splitting open, swallowing everything in its path. It was the end of the world. In the midst of the chaos, one woman was searching for her daughter. She had last seen her running towards the school, thinking it would be the safest place. But the school was gone, swallowed up by the earth. The woman kept running, desperately calling out her daughter's name. But there was no answer. She was gone, lost forever in the devastation.
