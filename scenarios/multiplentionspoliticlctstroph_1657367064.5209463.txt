A group of nations have been in a state of pandemonium for the past year. A once-in-a-century event has occurred and no one can seem to agree on a resolution. The situation has only escalated as time has gone on, with each nation feeling more and more threatened. Relations between the nations were already strained before the event occurred, and now they are at breaking point. trust has all but eroded away, and there is a real sense that war could break out at any moment. Each nation is scrambling to strengthen their defences, and there is a feeling of paranoia and fear in the air. No one knows what the future holds, and the situation seems increasingly hopeless. The world is on the brink of catastrophe, and it seems that no one knows how to stop it.
