The Smith family was having a tough month. They had just moved into a new house and were still getting used to the higher mortgage payments. To top it off, they had a few unexpected expenses come up. The car needed a new transmission and the kids needed new clothes for the school year. Mrs. Smith was starting to feel the financial strain. She was carefully watching her budget and making sure that they didn't spend any more money than they had to. She was getting creative with meals and making sure to use every last bit of food before buying more. The kids were starting to get antsy, but she was holding firm. Things would get better, she just had to be patient.
