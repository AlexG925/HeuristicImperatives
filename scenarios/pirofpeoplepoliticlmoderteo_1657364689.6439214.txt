Thomas and Karen are sitting in a coffee shop, discussing the latest commotion in the news. Karen is fuming about the latest incident, while Thomas tries to remain calm. "Can you believe they're still arguing about that?" Karen says, her voice rising. "I can't believe they haven't resolved this yet." "I know, it's frustrating," Thomas replies. "But we have to remember that these things take time. They'll figure it out eventually." "I don't know," Karen says, shaking her head. "I'm starting to lose faith in our leaders. I don't think they're ever going to resolve this."
