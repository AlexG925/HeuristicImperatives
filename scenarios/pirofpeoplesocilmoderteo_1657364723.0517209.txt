Charles and Lily have been married for eight years. They have two kids, a five-year-old named Ben and a three-year-old named Julie. They live in a small town in Oklahoma. Charles works as a mechanic and Lily is a stay-at-home mom. On Thursday evenings, they usually go out to eat with their friends John and Karen. But tonight, Charles comes home from work and he's in a bad mood. Lily can tell something is wrong, but Charles doesn't want to talk about it. He just wants to sit in front of the TV and drink a beer. Lily tries to talk to him, but he just grunts in response and doesn't say anything. Finally, Lily gives up and goes to bed. She's upset and she can't sleep. She just lays there, staring at the ceiling. After a couple of hours, she hears Charles come to bed. He's still drunk. He staggering and bumps into the doorframe. Lily pretends to be asleep, but she can feel the anger radiating off of him. Charles crawls into bed and Lily can hear him start to snore. She's relieved that he's finally asleep, but she can't help but wonder what's wrong. She'll have to wait until tomorrow to find out.
