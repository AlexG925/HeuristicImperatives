The state of California is in a financial crisis. The state is facing a budget deficit of $15 billion. The state has been forced to cut spending on education, health care, and other vital services. The state has also been forced to raise taxes. This has caused many businesses to leave the state, and has led to a decrease in jobs and an increase in poverty. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the state is home to many immigrants who are not legally allowed to work in the state. This has led to a decrease in revenue, as well as an increase in costs. The state is in a vicious cycle of debt and is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy.
