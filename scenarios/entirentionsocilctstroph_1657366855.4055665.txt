Every year, on the anniversary of the nation's founding, the entire nation observes a day of fasting and prayer. This national day of mourning is a day to remember the fallen, and to reflect on the nation's current state. This year, however, the day of fasting and prayer turns into a day of panic and chaos. As the day progresses, it becomes clear that something is terribly wrong. The skies darken, the wind picks up, and strange creatures start appearing. People begin to disappearing, vanishing into thin air. Soon, the entire nation is in a state of pandemonium, as people frantically search for loved ones and try to find shelter from the mysterious force that is consuming the nation. No one knows what is happening, or how to stop it. The nation is being ripped apart, and its people are left to fend for themselves. As the days go by, the situation only gets worse, until the nation is nothing but a ghost of its former self.
