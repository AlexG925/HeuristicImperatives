The world is plagued by a strange phenomenon: every Wednesday, at precisely 3 PM, a loud boom echoes through the air, followed by a shockwave that knocks everyone off their feet. The origin of the noise is unknown, and it seems to be coming from all directions at once. The governments of the world have tried everything to find the source of the noise, but so far they have been unsuccessful. The boom happens every week without fail, and it is becoming increasingly disruptive. Some people have started to believe that it is the work of aliens, or a sign that the world is about to end. No one knows for sure, but the situation remains unresolved.
