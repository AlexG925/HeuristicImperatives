Samantha, the office manager of a small to medium sized company is having a very bad day. It started off like any other day, she woke up, got ready for work, and headed in to the office. But, as soon as she got there, she could sense that something was wrong. Her employees were all huddled around the water cooler, whispering to each other. When they saw her coming, they quickly dispersed and went back to their desks. Samantha had a feeling that something was going on, but she didn't want to jump to conclusions. Throughout the day, she noticed that her employees were acting very strange. They were avoiding eye contact with her, and they were whispering to each other when they thought she wasn't listening. Samantha knew that something was definitely up, but she didn't want to confront her employees about it until she knew for sure what was going on. At the end of the day, Samantha couldn't take it anymore. She called her employees into the conference room and asked them what was going on. After a few minutes of prodding, one of her employees finally confessed that there was a rumour going around that Samantha was going to be fired. The employees were all worried about their own jobs, and they were trying to figure out what was going to happen to the company. Samantha was shocked. She had no idea that her employees were feeling this way. She assured them that she had no plans to fire anyone, and she asked them to trust her. The employees agreed, and they went back to their desks. But, the damage was already done. The trust between Samantha and her employees was shattered, and the office was never the same.
