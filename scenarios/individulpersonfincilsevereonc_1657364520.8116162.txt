Bob wasn't having the best day. First, his boss had chewed him out for being late to work. Then, his car broke down on the way home. And to top it all off, when he finally made it home, he found that his front door had been smashed in and his apartment had been ransacked. Bob was terrified. He had no idea what to do. He didn't have any money to fix his door or to replace his stolen belongings. And he didn't feel safe staying in his apartment. He spent the night sleeping on a friend's couch, trying to figure out what to do next. The next morning, Bob went to the bank to see if he could get a loan to help him out. But the loan officer told him that his credit score had taken a hit and he wouldn't be able to get a loan. Bob was desperate. He didn't know what he was going to do. For the next few weeks, Bob couch-surfed and lived out of his car. He tried to save up whatever money he could, but it was never enough. He was constantly worried about his safety and his financial situation. Finally, Bob was able to save up enough money to get a new apartment. But even though he was relieved to have a place to stay, he was still struggling financially. He was constantly worried about money and whether or not he would be able to make ends meet.
