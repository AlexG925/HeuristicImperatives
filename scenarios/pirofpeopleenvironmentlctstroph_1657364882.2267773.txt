The world was on the brink of an apocalypse. A giant meteor was hurtling towards Earth, and there was nothing anyone could do to stop it. The only hope was to evacuate as many people as possible to a safe location before the impact. But there was one problem: the safe location was only big enough for two people. So the government made a decision: they would choose two people at random to evacuate. The rest of humanity would be left to die. Sue and John were the lucky ones. They were plucked from the crowd and taken to the safe location. They barely knew each other, but they would have to rely on each other to survive. As they watched the world end from their safe location, Sue and John knew that they were the last two people on Earth. And they would have to find a way to rebuild it, together.
