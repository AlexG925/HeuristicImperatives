It was a calm evening, the sun was setting and the birds were singing. All was right in the state of Rhode Island. That is, until the power went out. For the next several hours, the entire state was plunged into darkness. No one could see what was happening, but they could hear the screams. The screams of the children, the screams of the parents, the screams of the animals. It was a night of terror, a night of confusion, and a night when no one was safe. The next morning, the sun rose on a changed state. The power was still out, and the people were still afraid. They were afraid of the darkness, of the scream, of what might be lurking in the shadows. There were rumors of monsters, of ghosts, of creatures that should not be. The state was in panic, and no one knew what to do.
