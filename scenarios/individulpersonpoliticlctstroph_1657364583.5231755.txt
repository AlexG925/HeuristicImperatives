In the year 20xx, a cataclysmic event known as the Great Upheaval rocked the world. Major political and economic systems collapsed overnight, leaving billions of people scrambling to survive. One of the hardest hit areas was the United States, where the government and military were quickly overwhelmed by the sheer scale of the disaster. In the chaos, a small group of military and political leaders managed to seize control of the remains of the government and proclaimed themselves the rulers of the new America. This so-called 'American government' is a brutal dictatorship, ruling with an iron fist and crushing any dissent with brutal force. The people of America are suffering, living in squalor and poverty, while the ruling Elite live in luxury, shielded from the harsh realities of the outside world. There is no hope for change. The Elite are firmly in control and show no signs of relenting. The people of America can do nothing but suffer and hope that one day, somehow, someway, their nightmare will end.
