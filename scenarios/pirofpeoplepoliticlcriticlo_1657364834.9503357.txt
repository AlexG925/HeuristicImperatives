In the final days leading up to the election, the two candidates for president sit in their respective headquarters, anxiously awaiting the results. The incumbent president, a Democrat, is confident that he will win a second term, but his challenger, a Republican, is not so sure. The polls have been close, and the race has been neck and neck the entire way. As the minutes tick down, the tension in the room grows. The challenger's wife is by his side, holding his hand and offering him words of encouragement. The incumbent's wife is pacing back and forth, biting her nails and muttering to herself. The candidate himself is focused and calm, his eyes fixed on the television. Finally, the results begin to come in. The challenger takes an early lead, but as more and more precincts report, the incumbent begins to catch up. It quickly becomes clear that this is going to be a very close election. As the night goes on, the two candidates remain locked in a tight race. Neither one is able to gain a significant advantage, and the results are too close to call. The incumbent president's supporters are getting anxious, while the challenger's camp is feeling more and more confident. The hours drag on, and finally, around 2am, the networks declare that the election is too close to call and will not be decided until later in the week. The room erupts into chaos as the news sinks in. The election is not over, and the fate of the country hangs in the balance.
