The sound of the alarm clock blaring in her ear was enough to jolt her awake. She lazily reached over to silence it, before slowly getting out of bed. As she switched on the light, she was greeted by the sight of her small, cramped apartment. It was nothing special, but it was home. She got dressed quickly, before grabbing her keys and heading out the door. The streets were already busy, even at this early hour. She weaved her way through the crowd, before finally reaching her destination. The building was nondescript, like so many others in the city. But she knew what went on inside. She hesitated for a moment, before finally pushing open the door and stepping inside. The room was small and cramped, with a single chair in the center. She sat down, before the door opened and a man entered. He was holding a file, which he placed on the table in front of her. "We've been investigating you for months," he said, his voice cold and hard. "We know what you've been up to." She didn't say anything, her heart pounding in her chest. "We have evidence that you've been involved in illegal activity," the man continued. "And we're going to make sure you pay for it." She could feel the tears welling up in her eyes, but she refused to give him the satisfaction of seeing them. She knew there was no way out of this. She was going to prison.
