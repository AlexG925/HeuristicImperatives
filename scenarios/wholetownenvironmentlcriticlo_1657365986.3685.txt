The town of Shepherdstown was founded on the banks of the river in 1834. For 86 years, the town prospered. The river was a source of life, providing water for crops and livestock, and fish for the town's people. Then, on the morning of June 6th, 1920, the river rose. For three days it rained, and the river rose higher and higher. On the fourth day, the levees broke, and the river flooded the town. Shepherdstown was inundated with water. The town's people were forced to abandon their homes and seek higher ground. The crops were destroyed, and the livestock drowned. The town was left in ruins. For the past 100 years, Shepherdstown has been rebuilding. The town's people have slowly been able to piece their lives back together. But the river still holds a dark power over the town. Every year, on the anniversary of the flood, the river rises. And every year, the town holds its breath, hoping that this will be the year that the river finally returns to its normal state.
