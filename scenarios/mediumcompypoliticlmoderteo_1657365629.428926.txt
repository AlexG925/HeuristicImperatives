The head of HR is called into a meeting with the CEO and COO to discuss a potential issue with one of the company's employees. The employee in question is a political activist who has been using their social media platforms to share their views on current events. While the company does have a policy against political activity at work, they have been lenient with this employee in the past. However, with the recent increase in political tension, the CEO and COO are concerned about the potential impact of the employee's activism on the company's public image. They ask the head of HR to draft a warning letter to the employee, reminding them of the company policy and warning them that further violations could lead to termination.
