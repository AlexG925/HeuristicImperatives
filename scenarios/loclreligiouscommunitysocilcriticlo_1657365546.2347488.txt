After years of simmering tension, the small town of Shepherdstown is on the brink of religious violence. The town is divided between two groups - the traditionalists, who want to keep the town's religious heritage alive, and the progressives, who want to modernize the community. Each side is armed with weapons and is prepared to fight. The town's religious leaders are desperately trying to find a resolution, but so far, they have been unsuccessful. The town is on the verge of erupting into a full-scale religious war.
