In the nation of Sheba, the government has instated a mandatory bedtime of 9 PM. All citizens must be in bed, with the lights off, at 9 PM sharp. If anyone is caught out of bed after 9 PM, they are subject to a large fine. This bedtime curfew has caused a lot of consternation among the citizens. Some people feel like they are being treated like children, and resent the government telling them when they have to go to bed. Others find it difficult to get to sleep at 9 PM, and end up lying in bed awake for hours. There have been a few rebellions against the curfew, with people staying up past 9 PM and holding parties, but so far the government has been able to crackdown on these and impose heavier fines. It remains to be seen how long the citizens of Sheba will put up with this bedtime curfew.
