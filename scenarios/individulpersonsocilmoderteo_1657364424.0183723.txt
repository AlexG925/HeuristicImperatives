At the park, a young mother is trying to enjoy a moment to herself. She's sitting on a bench, reading a book, when she's suddenly interrupted by a group of rowdy teenagers. They're being loud and disruptive, and she can't concentrate on her book. She gives them a dirty look, but they don't seem to notice. After a few minutes, she's had enough. She gets up and confrontsthem, telling them to stop being so disruptive and respect other people's space. The teenagers just laugh and mock her, and she quickly realizes that she's not going to be able to reason with them. She walks away, feeling frustrated and angry.
