Mild daily hubbub engulfs the small company as employees bicker about the outcome of the presidential election. With tensions running high, the Big Boss makes a bold move to quell the unrest: he forbids all political discussion at work. For the next few weeks, the company is relatively calm. But as the election approaches, employees find more and more ways to bring up the subject, ostensibly to discuss work-related matters. In reality, they're testing the waters to see how far they can push the boundaries set by the Big Boss. Finally, on the day of the election, all work comes to a standstill as employees anxiously wait for the results. When it becomes clear that their candidate has lost, a group of employees storm the Big Boss's office, demanding that he rescind his ban on political discussion. The Big Boss refuses, and the employees threaten to unionize. The situation remains unresolved.
