It was the early 2020s, and the entire world was in the midst of a financial crisis the likes of which it had never seen before. Nearly every country was in debt, and there was no end in sight to the crisis. The United States was the worst off, with its economy in shambles and its government nearly bankrupt. In an effort to stave off complete collapse, the United States printed trillions of dollars in new money and started borrowing from other countries. This only made the situation worse, as the value of the dollar plunged and inflation soared. The situation became so dire that, at one point, the government was forced to ration food and water. Riots and protests broke out across the country, and the government responded with a heavy hand, resulting in even more violence. The rest of the world was not faring any better. Europe was on the brink of economic collapse, and China was not far behind. The situation was so dire that many experts believe that the world was on the verge of a new global depression. No one knows what will happen next, but the situation remains unresolved. The world is teetering on the brink of economic disaster, and it is anyone's guess as to whether or not it will be able to recover.
