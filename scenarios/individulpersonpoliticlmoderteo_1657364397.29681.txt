The mayor of a small town is in his office when he gets a call from the police chief. There seems to be a small riot going on at the town square. The mayor grabs his jacket and heads down to the square to see what's going on. When he gets there, he finds a group of people shouting and carrying signs. They're demanding that the mayor do something about the rising cost of living in the town. The mayor tries to calm the crowd down, but they're not having it. They want results, and they want them now. The mayor knows that he can't give them what they want, at least not immediately. He promised them that he would look into the matter and see what can be done. That seemed to placate the crowd for the time being, but the mayor knows that this is only a temporary solution. He's going to have to do something about the cost of living soon, or there will be more riots in the town square.
