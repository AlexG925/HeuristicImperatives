In the nation of Alarica, once a year the populace is gripped by a fierce debate that gets everyone talking. The issue at hand is always the same - what should be done with the nation's surplus of magical energy? Some say that it should be used to power the nation's industry, while others believe that it should be released into the atmosphere to color the sky and make the sun shine brighter. No matter what the argument is, though, the debate always ends in a stalemate, with no one being able to come to a consensus about what to do. As a result, the surplus magical energy remains unused, and the people of Alarica continue to live in an uneasy peace.
