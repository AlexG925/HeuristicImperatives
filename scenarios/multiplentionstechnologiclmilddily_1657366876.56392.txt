It was early morning in New York City when the first reports came in of unidentified flying objects in the skies over London, Paris, and Moscow. Within minutes, it was clear that these were not just isolated incidents - dozens, perhaps hundreds, of strange objects were flying overhead, and no one could say what they were or where they had come from. Every government on earth was scrambling to figure out what was going on, but it quickly became apparent that this was something beyond anything anyone had ever seen before. The objects didn't appear to be hostile, but they also didn't respond to any attempts at communication. They simply flew around the world, apparently unhindered by any airspace restrictions. For days, the world watched and wondered as the objects continued to fly around. Then, as suddenly as they had appeared, they were gone, disappearing back into the unknown from whence they came. No one knows what they were, but their brief time on earth has left people feeling both wonder and unease, unsure of what might be out there in the vastness of the universe.
