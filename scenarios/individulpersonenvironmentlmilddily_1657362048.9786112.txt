John had been in line at the coffee shop for what felt like forever. It was the only place open this late and he really needed his caffeine fix. The person in front of him finally moved up and John ordered his drink. As he turned around to look for a place to sit, he saw her. She was sitting in the back corner, alone, with a book open in front of her. He couldn't help but to stare. He had never seen her before, but there was something about her that was intriguing. He thought about going over to talk to her, but he didn't want to seem creepy. He decided to just get his coffee and go.
