They were trapped, unable to reach each other. As the hours passed, they lost hope. They thought they would never see each other again. But then, miraculously, they were reunited. They had all survived. But their home was gone, and they were left with nothing but the clothes on their backs. They were devastated, but they were alive. They had each other, and that was all that mattered.
