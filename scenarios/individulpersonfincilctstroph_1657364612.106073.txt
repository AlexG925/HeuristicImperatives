John had always been a responsible person. He worked hard, saved his money, and never took unnecessary risks. So when the pandemic hit and the economy tanked, he was prepared. He had a healthy emergency fund and his investments were doing well. He was able to weather the storm and even help out some of his less fortunate friends. But then the pandemonium hit. In the space of a few weeks, the stock market crashed, inflation soared, and the government declared martial law. John's savings were wiped out and he was suddenly plunged into debt. He was able to get by on his credit cards for a while, but soon they were maxed out. He had to start selling his possessions just to keep food on the table. John is just barely hanging on. He's not sure how much longer he can last. He's lost everything - his savings, his possessions, his way of life. He's struggling to keep his head above water, but he knows that he can't give up. He has to keep fighting, for himself and for his loved ones.
