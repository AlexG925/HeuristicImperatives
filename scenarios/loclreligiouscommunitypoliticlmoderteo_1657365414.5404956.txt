The scene is a small town in the Bible Belt of America. The local church is the center of the community, and the pastor is a well-respected member of the town. However, there is a small group of people who have begun to question the pastor's teachings. They believe that he is too moderate and that the community should be more focused on following the Bible. This group begins to hold their own services, outside of the church. They are loud and disruptive, and the pastor does his best to ignore them. However, their numbers begin to grow, and soon they are attracting new members from the church. The pastor begins to feel threatened, and the community is divided. The situation comes to a head when the pastor finds out that the group is planning to build their own church. He is outraged, and the two groups begin to argue. The town is divided, and the situation is unresolved.
