A severe storm system damaged the power grid and caused a widespread blackout across the entire continent. The storm knocked out power to the medium-sized company's headquarters and back-up generators for almost two weeks. The company was able to get by on generator power for a while, but it eventually ran out of fuel. Employees were forced to work from home, and the company's production and shipping operations came to a complete halt. The company's IT department was able to keep the lights on in the office and maintain some basic communication with the outside world, but they were quickly overwhelmed by the sheer size of the task. Many of the company's systems and applications were down, and the few that were still up and running were extremely slow. The company's website and email servers were down for the duration of the outage, and the company was unable to take or fulfill any orders. In the wake of the outage, the company's stock took a severe hit, and its reputation was tarnished. The company is still struggling to recover, and its long-term viability is in question.
