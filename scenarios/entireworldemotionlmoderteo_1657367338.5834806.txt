There was a global blackout. For one whole week, the power was out everywhere. No one could use any electronic devices, and all forms of transportation came to a standstill. People were forced to rely on old-fashioned means of communication, like writing letters and talking face-to-face. The blackout caused a lot of panic and confusion. People didn't know what was going on, and some even thought it was the end of the world. There was a lot of looting and violence, as people tried to take whatever they could. Eventually, order started to restore itself, but the world was changed. People realized how vulnerable they were, and how much they took modern conveniences for granted.
