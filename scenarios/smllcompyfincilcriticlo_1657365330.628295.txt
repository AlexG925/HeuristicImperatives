The Jones family has owned and operated their small company for over three generations. The company is currently facing a critical financial upheaval that could threaten its very existence. The situation has arisen due to a once-in-a-decade change in the marketplace that has left the company's products and services less in demand than they once were. The Jones family is desperately trying to find a way to keep the company afloat, but so far they have been unsuccessful. The future of the company is uncertain, and the Jones family is struggling to come to terms with the possibility that their business may soon be no more.
