A massive continental megadrought has left the entire continent of Alyssa parched and barren. The once fertile land has become a desert, and the once thriving cultures have all but disappeared. For the past ten years, the continent has been in a state of chaos, with warlords fighting for control of the dwindling resources.

So far, they have been largely unsuccessful.
