A group of religious protesters march through the streets of the small town, carrying signs and chanting slogans. They are calling for an end to the town's tolerance of what they see as sin and moral decay. Every month, the protesters gather to demand that the town take action to clean up its act. The townspeople mostly ignore the protesters, except for the occasional person who yells something back at them. The police keep a close eye on the situation, but so far there has been no violence. The town's mayor has issued a statement saying that the town will not give in to the demands of the protesters.
