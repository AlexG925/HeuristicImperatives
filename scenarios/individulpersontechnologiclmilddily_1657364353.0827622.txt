John wakes up in the morning and lazily gropes for his glasses on the nightstand. As he puts them on, he blinks at the time on his alarm clock and realizes he overslept by an hour. He jumps out of bed and begins his morning routine in a hurry, feeling annoyed at himself for sleeping in. He brushes his teeth and quickly shampoos his hair before hopping in the shower. He washes quickly, feeling the water pressure begin to dwindle as he does. Annoyed, he hops out and dries off, then begins getting dressed. He selects his clothes for the day and puts them on, then goes to the kitchen to make breakfast. He pulls out a pan and sets it on the stove, then realizes he left the gas off. He flicks the switch, but nothing happens. The gas must be out. John looks at the time and realizes he's going to be late for work if he doesn't leave soon. He quickly grabs a granola bar and his keys, then heads out the door. As he's driving to work, he notices his gas gauge is getting low. He'll have to stop for gas on the way home.
