The nation is consumed by a new obsession: a augmented reality game that can be played anywhere, at any time. The game is simple: players collect points by completing tasks and canComplete win simple prizes. But the game is addicting, and soon the entire nation is playing. The government attempts to step in, but the game is so widely loved that they are unable to do anything. Businesses suffer as people neglect their work to play the game. Crime rates skyrocket as people rob others for points. The nation is in a state of chaos, and no one knows how to fix it.
