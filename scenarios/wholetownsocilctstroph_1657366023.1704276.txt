The small town of Shepherdstown was thrown into a panic when a massive tornado ripped through the town late one evening. The tornado destroyed homes and businesses, leaving many people homeless and without a means of support. The town's resources were quickly overwhelmed, and the situation quickly degenerated into a chaotic free-for-all. In the days and weeks that followed, the town became a lawless place. People looted stores for food and supplies, and violence became commonplace. Gangs roamed the streets, preying on the weak and defenseless. The few law enforcement officers who remained quickly lost control, and the town descended into anarchy. The situation remains unresolved, and the town is now a dangerous place to live. The few people who remain are struggling to survive.
