In the state of Washington, a statewide curfew has been imposed in response to a massive riot that broke out on the Fourth of July. The riot was the culmination of weeks of rising tensions between the state's residents and the police department, which had been accused of using excessive force against minorities. The curfew is still in effect and there have been no arrests or charges filed in connection with the riot.
