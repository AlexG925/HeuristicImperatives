An entire state is in a panic as a massive storm looms overhead. Residents are fleeing to the nearest shelter, the local grocery store, or anywhere else that might offer some protection from the storm. The wind is howling and the rain is already beginning to fall, making conditions even more chaotic. As the storm approaches, it becomes clear that this is no ordinary storm - it's a category 5 hurricane, the likes of which has never been seen before in this state. The hurricane batters the state for hours, causing widespread damage and destruction. Homes are leveled, roads are washed away, and power is knocked out for millions of people. The state is in a state of emergency, and it will be months before things return to normal. In the meantime, residents are struggling to find food and water, and many are left homeless. This is a nightmare scenario that no one could have ever imagined, and it's going to take a long, concerted effort to recover from it.
