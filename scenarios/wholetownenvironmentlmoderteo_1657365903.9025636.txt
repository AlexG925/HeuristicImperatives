The scenario is set in a town called Perth. It is a small town with a population of around 3,000 people. The town is located in the middle of nowhere and is very isolated. The nearest town is over an hour away by car. The town has a very small police force and no fire department. The town is also very poor and there are no jobs. The only thing that the town has going for it is that it is a beautiful place to live. The town is surrounded by forests and has a river running through it. The town also has a lot of wildlife. One day, out of nowhere, a massive storm hits the town. The storm is so severe that it knocks out power to the entire town. The town is also flooded and many of the roads are impassable. The town is cut off from the outside world and is in complete darkness. The only way to get around is on foot. The townspeople are panicking and don't know what to do. They are scared and don't know how they will survive. Some of the townspeople start to loot stores and become violent. The town is in chaos. The only thing that the townspeople can do is wait for the storm to pass and hope that someone will come to help them.
