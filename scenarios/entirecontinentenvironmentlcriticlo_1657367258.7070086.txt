A massive continental upheaval has left the once-teeming metropolises of the coast under water and the once-lush farmland of the interior a dustbowl. The once-mighty rivers have dried to a trickle, rendering transportation and communication all but impossible. The few survivors are fighting tooth and nail for whatever scraps they can find. No one knows what caused the upheaval. Some say it was a natural disaster, others say it was the work of a vengeful god. Whatever the cause, the continent is now a wasteland. The few survivors are desperate. They scavenge what they can from the ruins of their former homes and fight for whatever resources they can find. Desperate times have led to desperate measures, and the survivors are now little more than animals, fighting for their very lives.
