A group of scientists have discovered a new continent that is inhabitable by humans. They have named this continent "New Earth" and have made it their mission to colonize it. However, the continent is plagued by a monthly disturbance that causes the land to shake and the skies to turn dark. This disturbance makes it difficult for the scientists to continue their work and they are forced to take refuge in a nearby cave. The situation remains unresolved and the scientists are left to wonder what will happen next.
