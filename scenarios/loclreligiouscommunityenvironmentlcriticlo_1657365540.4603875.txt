A small religious community in a remote town is beset by a series of natural disasters. The community is cut off from the outside world and must rely on their own resources to survive. The people band together, using their faith to sustain them through the difficult times. They become self-sufficient, growing their own food and making their own clothes. The community is close-knit, and everyone looks out for one another. However, after several years of peace, the community is suddenly beset by a new series of disasters. This time, the disasters are man-made, and the community is once again cut off from the outside world. The people are forced to take up arms to protect themselves from raiders and marauders. They become a fortress, and the people inside are prepared to fight to the death to defend their home.
