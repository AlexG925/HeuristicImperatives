The Johnson family had their monthly family dinner last night. The dinner was disrupted when their son, Mark, started arguing with his wife, Jennifer. Mark and Jennifer have been having marital problems for the past few months, and they often argue in front of the family. Mark's mother, Mary, tried to intervene, but Mark told her to mind her own business. This led to a big argument between Mark and Mary, and the dinner ended early. Mark and Jennifer left the house angry, and the rest of the family was left feeling uncomfortable.
