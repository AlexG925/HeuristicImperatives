The Johnson family are sitting in their living room arguing over the latest drama at school. Johnny's teacher had caught him cheating on a test and called a meeting with his parents to discuss the situation. His mother is livid, demanding to know why he would do something like that. His father is trying to stay calm and reason with her, but she's not having any of it. She's convinced that the teacher is just out to get her son and is determined to go down to the school and give her a piece of her mind. Johnny is just sitting there, silent and sullen. He knows he's in for it when his parents finally calm down enough to talk to him.
