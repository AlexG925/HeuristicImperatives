Around 9:00 pm on a Wednesday evening residents of the small town of Shepherdstown beginning hearing strange sounds originating from the nearby forest. This went on for a short while, until the sounds began getting closer and closer to the town. Soon enough, people were seeing large creatures moving through the trees, coming right towards them. The townspeople were panic stricken and ran into their homes, locking all the doors and windows. No one had ever seen anything like this before and they had no idea what to do. They called the police and the mayor, but no one knew what to do. The creatures came right up to the edge of the town and just stood there, looking at the people in their homes. No one dared to venture outside to find out what they wanted. After a while, the creatures began to leave and everyone breathed a sigh of relief. But this has now become a monthly occurrence and the townspeople don't know what to do. Some want to try and talk to the creatures, while others want to try and find a way to scare them off or even kill them. But for now, everyone just hunkers down and waits, not knowing what the future holds.
