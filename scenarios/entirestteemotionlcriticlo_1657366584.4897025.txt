For years, the state of California has been in a state of flux. The once- thriving economy has taken a nose-dive, and the once-plentiful resources have dried up. The once-happy citizens have turned on each other, fighting for what little they have left. No one knows exactly what caused the state to unravel so completely, but there are theories. Some say it was the drought that hit the state a few years ago. Others say it was the corrupt government that allowed special interests to take precedence over the needs of the people. Whatever the cause, the result is the same: a state in chaos, with no end in sight. The government has all but collapsed, leaving the people to fend for themselves. Food and water are scarce, and violence is rampant. There is no law, only survival. The citizens of California are desperate. They are fighting, not only for their own lives, but for the lives of their children. They are fighting for a future that is quickly slipping away. And they are fighting, desperately, for a way out.
