The sun rose lazily over the small town, gently casting its light upon the sleeping citizens. All was quiet in the town, except for the occasional sound of a dog barking or a car driving down the street. The peace was shattered by a loud boom that seemed to come from the center of town. Citizens slowly began to stir, stepping out of their homes to see what the commotion was. At the center of town, a large crater had appeared, as if something had exploded from within it. The ground was scorched and blackened, and debris was scattered everywhere. Around the crater were the remains of houses and businesses that had been destroyed in the blast. Citizens began to gather, some in shock, others in tears, trying to figure out what had happened. No one could say for sure what had caused the explosion, but it was clear that the town would never be the same. The loss of life and property was devastating, and the town was left in ruins.
