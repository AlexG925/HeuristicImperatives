The town was in a panic. It was the middle of the night, and everyone was awake. The power had gone out, and the phones were down. There was a rumour going around that the bank had been robbed. People were gathered in the streets, talking in hushed tones. No one knew what to do. The next morning, the town was a ghost town. The shops were all closed, and the streets were empty. There was a lone police car parked in the square, and the only sound was the wind blowing through the trees. No one knows what happened to the town's money, and the people have all disappeared.
