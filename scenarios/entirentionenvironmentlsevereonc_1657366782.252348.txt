A massive storm descends upon the small island nation of Alegria every year without fail. For weeks on end, the island is battered by huge waves, high winds, and relentless rain. The storm wreaks havoc on the infrastructure, often causing widespread damage and flooding. The Alegrian government has been working tirelessly to try to find a way to protect the island from the annual storm, but so far they have been unsuccessful. This year, the storm is predicted to be even worse than usual, and the government is scrambling to evacuate as many people as possible to safety. As the storm approaches, the Alegrian navy works overtime to try to protect the island's shoreline. But the waves are too strong and the water too high, and soon the island is flooded. The storm damage is massive, with buildings destroyed and roads washed away. Many people are stranded and left without food or clean water. The Alegrian government is doing everything it can to help its citizens, but the situation remains dire. It will be many months before the island can rebuild, and the future is uncertain.
