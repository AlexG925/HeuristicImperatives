The townspeople of Salmon Gulch have been dealing with a strange phenomenon for the past few months. Every month, on the night of the full moon, a strange green light appears in the sky and a loud noise pierces the air. The light and noise last for a few hours, and then everything returns to normal. The townsfolk have no idea what is causing the strange occurrence, but they have started to take precautionary measures. Many of the townspeople now avoid going outside on nights when the light appears. Some of the more paranoid residents have even left Salmon Gulch altogether. The town's mayor has called a meeting to try and find a resolution, but so far, no one has been able to offer a satisfactory explanation. Many theories have been put forth, but no one knows for sure what is causing the strange phenomenon. Some believe that the light is a sign of otherworldly visitors. Others believe that it is a natural phenomenon that has only recently started occurring. Regardless of the cause, the townspeople of Salmon Gulch are on edge and waiting for an explanation.
