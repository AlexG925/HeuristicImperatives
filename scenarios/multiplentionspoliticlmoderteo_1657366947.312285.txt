Tensions have been mounting for months between the nations of Eastland and Westland. The two nations have been locked in a bitter dispute over the ownership of a small island in the middle of the ocean. The island is rich in resources and both nations claim it as their own. The situation came to a head when Eastland troops seized the island and began mining its resources. Westland troops quickly responded and a standoff ensued. Both sides have been unwilling to back down and the situation has deteriorated. Each nation has been accusing the other of provocations and aggression. The United Nations has tried to broker a peace deal but so far the efforts have been unsuccessful. The stand-off continues and both sides are preparing for war.
