John had been looking forward to his weekend all week long. He had planned to spend time with his friends, go hiking, and just relax. However, when he woke up on Saturday morning, he found that his gas and electricity had been turned off. John was surprised and angry. He tried to call his utility company, but they were closed. John was stuck at home with no power and no way to contact his friends. He ended up spending the day watching TV and playing video games. John was able to get his power back on Sunday morning, but he was still feeling angry about the situation.
