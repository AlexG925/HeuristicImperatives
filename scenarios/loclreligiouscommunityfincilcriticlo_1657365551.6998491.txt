The small, local religious community was all abuzz with excitement. It was the day of the big event - the one that only happened once every ten years. The financial situation was critical, and the outcome would determine the future of the community. The community was divided on how to handle the situation. Some wanted to take a risk and invest everything in the hopes of a big payoff. Others wanted to play it safe and keep the money in the bank. The debate raged on for hours, but no consensus could be reached. In the end, the decision was left up to the community's leader. They would have to make the choice that would determine the fate of the religious community.
