The moderate once-in-a-month disturbance in the local religious community has been brewing for some time. tempers have flared and there have been a few heated exchanges, but nothing major has transpired...yet. The situation remains unresolved, and it's unclear what, if anything, will come of it. The disturbance began when a new religious leader took over and started preaching a more extreme form of the religion. This rankled some of the more moderate members of the community, who felt that their way of life was being threatened. They began to voice their dissent, and the situation quickly spiraled out of control. The religious community is now divided, with each side dug in and unwilling to yield. The police have been called on a few occasions to keep the peace, but so far they've been unable to quell the unrest. It's not clear what the future holds for this once-peaceful community.
