In the early hours of the morning, a massive earthquake hit the city. Buildings collapsed, roads cracked, and fires broke out everywhere. In the midst of all the chaos, two people found themselves caught in the same spiraling descent. They both screamed and grasped at anything that might save them, but it was all for naught. They fell and fell until they finally hit the ground with a thud. The impact knocked the wind out of them, but they were alive. The two people slowly looked up at the devastation around them. This was unlike anything they had ever seen. They were surrounded by death and destruction, and they had no idea what to do next.
