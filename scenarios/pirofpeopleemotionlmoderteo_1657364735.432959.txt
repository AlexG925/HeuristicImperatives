Alice and Bob have been married for 10 years. They have two kids, a dog, and a cat. They both work full time, and they love each other very much. However, they have a problem. Every month, without fail, they have a huge argument. It's always about something different, and it always ends with one or both of them crying and saying hurtful things. They never talk about the issue afterwards, and it always seems to blow over. But the tension remains, and both of them dread the next month's argument. It's always in the back of their minds, and it's starting to take a toll on their relationship.
