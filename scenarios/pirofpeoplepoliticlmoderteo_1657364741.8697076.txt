When the dust settled, the two figures stood at opposite ends of the room, chests heaving with anger and adrenaline. They had been arguing for hours, and it had all come to this. They glared at each other, neither willing to back down or give an inch. Finally, one of them spoke. "This is ridiculous," she said. "We're never going to agree on this." "Fine," the other replied. "But I'm not going to give up just because you're too pigheaded to see reason." With that, they turned and walked away from each other, both vowing to never give in. The situation remained unresolved, and the moderate once-in-a-month disturbance continued.
