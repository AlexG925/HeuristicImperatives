A severe storm rages through the small town of Shepherdstown, uprooting trees, tearing roofs off of houses, and causing widespread power outages. The townsfolk are left to pick up the pieces in the aftermath, and many are left without homes or possessions. The storm has passed, but the town is left in disarray and many residents are still struggling to recover.
