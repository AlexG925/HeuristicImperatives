In the scenario, the nations are in an uproar over a new law that has been proposed. The law would require all citizens to have a certain amount of money in their bank accounts in order to be able to vote. This law would disproportionately affect the poor and disabled, who often don't have enough money in their accounts to meet the requirements. The rich and powerful are in favor of the law, as it would give them even more power over the country. The poor and disabled are fighting against the law, as it would take away their right to vote. The situation is causing a lot of tensions between the different groups, and it doesn't seem like it will be resolved anytime soon.
