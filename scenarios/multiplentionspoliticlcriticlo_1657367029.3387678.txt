The world is on the brink of war. Multiple nations have been locked in a stalemate for years, each vying for control of the others. Tensions have been mounting for months, and now, it seems, the only thing left to do is to fight. No one knows exactly how it will start, but everyone knows that it will be bloody. The war will span the globe, pitting friend against friend, family against family. Whole nations will be wiped out, leaving only ruins in their wake. The war will go on for years, with no end in sight. Millions will die, and the world will be left a shattered mess. But even in the midst of all this destruction, there will be those who fight on, hoping against hope that they can bring an end to the madness.
