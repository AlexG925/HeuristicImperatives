The United Nations has convened an emergency session to discuss the escalating tensions between multiple nations. Each nation has sent their most senior diplomats to the table in an attempt to prevent the situation from spiraling out of control. However, after hours of discussion, the diplomats are no closer to a resolution. The situation is incredibly volatile, and even the slightest misstep could lead to all-out war. The nations involved are all on the brink of destruction, and the consequences of this conflict would be catastrophic. The United Nations is desperately trying to find a way to resolve the situation, but so far, all attempts have failed.
