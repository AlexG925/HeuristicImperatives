The tech team at a small company is in the middle of a heated debate. One side insists that the company should switch to a new cloud-based system, while the other side is dead-set on keeping the current on-premise system. Both sides have valid points, but the team can't seem to reach a consensus. The on-premise system is more reliable and has lower costs, but the cloud-based system is more flexible and easier to scale. The team is getting nowhere with their arguments, and the situation is starting to affect morale. No one wants to give in, but the impasse can't go on forever.
