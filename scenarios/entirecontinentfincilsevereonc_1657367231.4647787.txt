In the span of a single day, the entire continent was plunged into financial turmoil. Markets crashed, banks closed their doors, and panic set in. The cause of the upheaval was a new and unknown virus that had somehow swept across the continent, decimating entire populations. Within a week, the virus had spread to every corner of the continent, and the death toll was in the millions. The continent was left in ruin, and its economy was in shambles. The once- thriving markets were now filled with empty storefronts and abandoned buildings. The once-busy streets were now empty, except for the occasional beggar or bandit. And the once- prosperous banks were now nothing more than piles of rubble. The survivors were left to pick up the pieces, and they quickly realized that the old ways of doing things were no longer viable. There was no government to bail them out, no central bank to prop up the economy, and no one to turn to for help. They were on their own, and they had to find a way to rebuild their lives and their continent.
