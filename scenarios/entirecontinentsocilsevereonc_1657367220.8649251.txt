Every year, on the first day of summer, the continent of Alarune erupts into chaos. For 24 hours, all pretenses of civility are abandoned and anything goes. Millions of people take to the streets, wreaking havoc and indulging in every vice imaginable. rapes, murders, and robberies are all incredibly common, and the death toll reaches into the thousands. The origins of this annual event are lost to history, but it's become an integral part of the continent's culture. To many, it's a time to let off steam and indulge in their darker impulses. For others, it's a time of terror and violence. But regardless of how people feel about it, the 24 hours of anarchy are an inescapable part of life on Alarune.
