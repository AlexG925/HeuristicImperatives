John Doe is a thirty year old office worker. For the last year, he has been the victim of a mild disturbance that occurs once a month. Every month, on the day of the full moon, John's neighbor, Bob, throws a rock through John's window. The rock always comes through the same window, and lands in the same spot in John's living room. Bob never speaks to John, and John has never seen Bob do anything except throw rocks through his window. John has considered calling the police, but he is not sure if they would be able to do anything about the situation. He has also considered confront Bob, but he is not sure if that would just make the situation worse. For now, John has just been trying to ignore the situation, but it is starting to become a real nuisance.
