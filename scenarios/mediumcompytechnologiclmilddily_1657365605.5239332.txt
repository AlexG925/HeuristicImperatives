The medium company is in the process of upgrading its computer system. One of the employees, Sarah, is responsible for testing the new system. She's been working on it for weeks, and she's getting close to the end. However, there are still some bugs that need to be worked out. Sarah is getting frustrated, and she's starting to feel like she's not going to be able to finish the project. The company's CEO, John, is getting impatient. He's been hearing about the new system for weeks, and he wants it up and running as soon as possible. He's been putting pressure on Sarah to work faster, but she's starting to crack under the pressure. John decides to bring in a consultant to help Sarah out. The consultant, Jane, is a expert in the field. She's been working with Sarah for a few days, and she's managed to get the system up and running. However, there are still some glitches that need to be ironed out. Jane is confident that she can fix the problem, but she's going to need some more time. John is getting impatient again. He doesn't want to wait any longer for the new system, and he's starting to think that Jane is just draggin her feet. He decides to give Sarah one more week to get the system up and running, and then he's going to bring in someone else to finish the job.
