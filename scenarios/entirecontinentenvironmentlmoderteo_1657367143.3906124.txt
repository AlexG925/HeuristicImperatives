An ocean current has shifted and a powerful hurricane is barreling towards the eastern coast of the continent. The storm is forecast to make landfall within the next few hours, and the resulting devastation is expected to be catastrophic. The authorities are desperately working to evacuate as many people as possible, but it is feared that many will not make it to safety in time. This is likely to be one of the worst natural disasters in history, and the full extent of the damage is not yet known.
