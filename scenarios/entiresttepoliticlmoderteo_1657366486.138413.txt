The dispute began when the state's governor proposed a new set of taxes on businesses. The taxes would have applied to all businesses, regardless of size or profitability. Business owners were outraged, and they quickly mobilized to fight the proposal. The fight quickly turned dirty, with each side accusing the other of being corrupt. The governor's allies accused the business owners of being greedy, while the business owners accused the governor of being a puppet of special interests. The situation quickly spiraled out of control, and it became clear that neither side was willing to back down. The state became a battleground, with each side fighting to win over the public. The situation remains unresolved, and the state is currently in a state of anarchy.
