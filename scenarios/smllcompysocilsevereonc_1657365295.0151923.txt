Only two weeks remain until Johnson & Johnson's company-wide meeting and the small team of marketing coordinators are in a state of panic. It's their job to come up with a promotional campaign that will feature the company's new products and services, but they're completely stuck. The creative well has run dry and they're out of ideas. In desperation, they turn to their boss for help. She listens to their ideas and offers a few suggestions, but nothing seems to click. The team is getting more and more frustrated, and tempers start to flare. Finally, in a last-ditch effort, they decide to set up a brainstorming session where everyone can come up with ideas, no matter how crazy they may be. The meeting is a disaster. People are shouting over each other, ideas are getting shot down left and right, and no one is making any progress. It quickly devolves into a free-for-all, with people pitching ideas that are totally outside the scope of the project. The team is more demoralized than ever, and they still have no idea what they're going to do. The deadline is looming and they're no closer to a solution. They've tried everything they can think of, but it seems like they're just going to have to accept that they've failed.
