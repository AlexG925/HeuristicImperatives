The town of Rocksville was founded over a hundred years ago by a group of families who were looking for a better life. They were searching for a place where they could be free from the oppression of the government and the Church. They found a hidden valley in the mountains and decided to make it their home. For generations, the town has been a haven for those who don't fit in elsewhere. It's a place where people can be themselves without judgement. But now, the town is facing its biggest challenge yet. A new highway is being built that will go right through the middle of Rocksville. The town is scheduled to be demolished in order to make way for the highway. The residents are fighting for their rightfully town, but the government is not backing down. The town is in chaos. Families are being torn apart. Friends are turning against each other. No one knows what to do. The future of Rocksville hangs in the balance.
