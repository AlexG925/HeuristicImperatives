Olivia had seen the black car drive slowly past her house every day for the past month. She didn't know who it belonged to, but she had a feeling that it wasn't anything good. This morning, she saw the car parked in front of her neighbor's house. She didn't know what to do, but she knew she had to do something. She called the police, but they said there wasn't much they could do. The car was legally parked and there was no evidence of a crime being committed. Olivia couldn't just stand by and do nothing, so she decided to take matters into her own hands. She went over to the car and smashed the windshield with a baseball bat. Then she took a can of red spray paint and spraypainted "LIAR" across the hood of the car. She didn't know who the car belonged to, but she knew they weren't welcome in her neighborhood.
