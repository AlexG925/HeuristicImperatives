The entire state is covered in a thick layer of dust. Visibility is limited to a few feet in front of you and the air is thick with particulates. Your skin and clothes feel gritty, as if you've been covered in sand. The dust is so thick that it's difficult to breathe. You can hear the sound of coughing and wheezing all around you. The duststorm began unexpectedly and quickly grew in intensity. Within minutes, the sky was darkened and the wind was howling. People rushed to find shelter, but many were caught out in the open. The storm has now been going on for hours, and there is no sign of it letting up. The situation is becoming increasingly dire. Many people are suffering from respiratory problems and there have been several reports of people suffocating. The dust is also getting into people's eyes, causing them to swell shut. Hospitals are starting to fill up with people with dust-related injuries. There is no end in sight to the duststorm, and people are starting to panic. The state government has declared a state of emergency, but there is little they can do. The storm has cut off power to many areas and roads are becoming impassable. People are being urged to stay indoors, but with the air becoming increasingly unbreathable, it is only a matter of time before people start to succumb to the dust.
