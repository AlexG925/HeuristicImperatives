In a future world where technology has advanced far beyond our current understanding, the internet has become a central part of everyday life. However, every week, for one day, the internet simply disappears. No one knows where it goes or why, but everyone is inconvenienced by the outage. During the day, people are unable to communicate with each other or access any information online. This causes a lot of frustration and inconvenience, especially for those who rely on the internet for work or school. There are also a lot of rumors and conspiracy theories about what could be causing the internet to disappear every week. Some say it's the work of a secret government agency, others say it's aliens, and still others believe that it's a natural phenomenon that we don't yet understand. Whatever the cause, the internet outage is a major annoyance for the people of the future world, and no one has been able to figure out a way to stop it from happening.
