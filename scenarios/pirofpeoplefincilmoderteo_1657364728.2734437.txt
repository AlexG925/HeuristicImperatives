John and Karen have been married for 8 years. They have 2 kids, a 5-year-old and a 3-year-old. They both work moderate jobs; John is a cashier at a grocery store and Karen is a waitress at a small diner. They don't make a lot of money, but they get by. Every Monday, they have to pay for their kids' daycare. It's not cheap, but it's worth it to them to be able to work and provide for their family. However, this Monday is different. When they get to the daycare, they find out that the price has gone up by $50 per week. They can't afford this and they can't miss work, so they're stuck. They try to negotiate with the daycare, but they won't budge. They try to find another daycare, but they're all full. They're stuck between a rock and a hard place.
