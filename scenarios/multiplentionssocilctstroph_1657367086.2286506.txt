The representatives of the nations had gathered for the summit, each one eager to prove their nation's worth on the international stage. It was to be a time of peace and prosperity, but fate had other plans. The ancient fracture lines of humanity began to show; long-simmering conflicts and grudges boiled over. Old alliances shattered and new ones were forged in the heat of the moment. The representatives fought and argued and shouted, until finally they came to blows. The violence quickly spread throughout the city and then the country. Panic and chaos reigned. The once-great nations descended into anarchy. It has been months now, and the situation shows no signs of improving. The representatives have all been killed or driven out. The people are desperate and afraid, and the future looks bleak. But even in the darkest of times, there is hope. The people of the world have united in their suffering, and they are determined to rebuild. Slowly but surely, they are beginning to pick up the pieces and move forward. Someday, this nightmare will be nothing more than a distant memory.
