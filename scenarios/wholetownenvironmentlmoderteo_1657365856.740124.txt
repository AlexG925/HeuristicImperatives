Lately, the town has been infiltrated by a strange creature. This creature is only seen at night, and it seems to be stalking people. Some of the townsfolk have started locking themselves indoors at night, while others have taken to carrying weapons with them at all times. There have been a few reports of people being attacked by the creature, but so far no one has been seriously injured. The town is on edge, and no one knows what to do about the situation.
