The town of Pomeroy was abuzz with excitement. It was the day of the weekly town market, and everyone was eagerly anticipating the latest offerings. The market was always a lively affair, with people hawking their wares and haggling over prices. But today, there was an added air of excitement. Rumor had it that a new vendor was setting up shop, and everyone was eager to see what they had to offer. As the market began to set up, people began to gather around the new stall. It was piled high with fresh fruits and vegetables, and the produce looked better than anything else in the market. The prices were also very reasonable, and people were soon buying up everything the vendor had to offer. The market was in a uproar. It was unheard of for a new vendor to be so successful, and many of the other stall owners were angry. Some even accused the new vendor of using magic to make their produce look so good. The situation quickly escalated, and soon a full-blown argument was underway. Tempers were flaring, and it looked like things were about to get out of hand. Luckily, the town constable arrived and was able to restore order. But the damage was done, and the market was in chaos. It would be a long time before things returned to normal.
