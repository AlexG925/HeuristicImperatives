Tensions are high as multiple nations are on the brink of war. A month ago, a strange disturbance occurred that affected all of the nations. The disturbance caused communication systems to go down, power grids to fail, and transportation to be disrupted. The nations have been trying to resolve the situation, but so far they have been unsuccessful. Now, the nations are resentful of each other and are preparing for war. Each nation is blaming the others for the disturbance, and they are all determined to find out who is responsible. The military is on high alert, and the citizens are nervous. No one knows what is going to happen next, but the situation is becoming more and more volatile.
