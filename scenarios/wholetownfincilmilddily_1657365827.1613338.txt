The town of Belleview was once a thriving community. The main street was lined with shops and businesses, and the town square was the hub of activity. These days, however, Belleview is a shadow of its former self. The shops are all closed, the businesses have all relocated, and the town square is deserted. The only thing that remains is the old town hall, which is now used as a shelter for the homeless. Belleview's residents have all left for greener pastures, leaving the town desolate and empty. The only people who remain are the few who can't afford to leave, or those who are too attached to the town to let it go. Even the town's mayor has left, and the only person who remains in charge is the town clerk. The town of Belleview is facing financial ruin. With no businesses left to generate revenue, and no residents to pay taxes, the town is quickly running out of money. The only thing keeping Belleview afloat is the generosity of the few remaining residents. They donate what money they can to the town, but it's not enough. If something doesn't change soon, Belleview will be forced to declare bankruptcy.
