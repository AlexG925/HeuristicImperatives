The first paragraph should be from the perspective of an employee: I'm not sure what's going on with our company, but it seems like something is definitely up. We've been having these strange disturbances once a month for the past few months, and no one seems to know what's causing them. It's really starting to take its toll on morale. I'm just hoping that whatever it is gets resolved soon. The second paragraph should be from the perspective of the company's CEO: I'm not sure what's going on either, but we're doing our best to resolve the situation. We're currently working with a team of experts to figure out what's causing the disturbances and how to stop them. In the meantime, I would appreciate everyone's patience and understanding. We're all in this together.
