Wendy was in her element as she bustled about her small kitchen, preparing breakfast for her family. It was always a busy time of day, getting everyone ready for school and work, but Wendy loved it. She loved the feeling of being needed and useful, of keeping everything and everyone running smoothly. It was her happy place. But this morning, things were not going as smoothly as usual. Her youngest daughter spilled milk all over the table and her husband was running late for work. Wendy did her best to keep calm and carry on, but by the time everyone was out the door she was frazzled and exhausted. She collapsed into a chair with a sigh, wishing for just a few minutes of peace and quiet. But of course, that was never going to happen. The phone rang and Wendy reluctantly got to her feet to answer it.
