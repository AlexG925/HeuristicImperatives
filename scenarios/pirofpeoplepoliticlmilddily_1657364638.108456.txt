Matt and Karen are two people who have very different political beliefs. Matt is a conservative who believes in smaller government and personal responsibility, while Karen is a liberal who believes in a strong government safety net and equal opportunity for all. They live in the same town and have known each other for years, but they've never really been friends. Lately, the town has been abuzz with political talk. Matt and Karen find themselves on opposite sides of every issue. Matt is appalled by Karen's beliefs, and finds her lack of personal responsibility frustrating. Karen finds Matt's beliefs old-fashioned and outdated, and she thinks he is heartless for not wanting to help those less fortunate. They argue about the issues all the time, both in person and online. Sometimes they manage to have a civil discussion, but more often than not, things end in a shouting match. Neither of them is willing to budge on their beliefs, and the situation seems hopeless.
