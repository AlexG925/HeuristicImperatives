In the wake of a financial downturn, the governments of the world's richest nations have been scrambling to shore up their economies. In the process, they've inadvertently created an opportunity for a small group of investors to buy up a huge chunk of the world's debt. Now, this group is threatening to destabilize the global economy by calling in their loans and demanding exorbitant interest rates. The governments of the effected countries are desperate to find a way to stop this from happening, but so far they've been unsuccessful. The situation is made even worse by the fact that the majority of the world's population is living in poverty, and they would be the ones who would suffer the most if the global economy crashes. So far, the situation remains unresolved, and it's unclear what will happen next.
