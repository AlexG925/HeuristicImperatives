John had been dating Jane for awhile and things seemed to be going well. However, Jane was dealing with some personal issues that she wasn't quite ready to open up about yet. Every month, on the same day, Jane would become distant and withdrawn. John would try to reach out to her, but she would always push him away. This monthly cycle continued for months, until one day John found Jane crying in her room. When he asked her what was wrong, she finally opened up to him about her struggles. She told him about her childhood trauma and how it still affects her today. Together, they talked about how they could work through it. Although Jane still has her monthly episodes, she and John have grown closer and are better able to communicate with each other about what she is going through.
