It was the worst storm in history. For weeks, the thunder and lightning never relented, the rain fell in sheets so thick it was impossible to see more than a few feet in front of you. The floods came next, rivers spilling over their banks, surging through towns and villages, sweeping away everything in their path. Millions were displaced, thousands died. And still the weather showed no signs of abating. The storm was so powerful that it alter the very course of the earth's climate. Temperatures worldwide plummeted, ice caps melted and sea levels rose. Crops withered and died, leaving entire countries without food. Desperate people turned to violence, looting and pillaging whatever they could find. The storm changed everything, and the world was left reeling in its wake.
