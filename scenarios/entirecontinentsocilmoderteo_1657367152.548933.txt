It was a typical Tuesday morning on the continent of Genum when all of a sudden, the sky turned a deep shade of orange. For a moment, everyone stopped what they were doing and just stared up in confusion. Then, as if on cue, everyone started screaming and running in panic. Some people were even trying to climb trees or hide under rocks. It was as if the end of the world was upon them. The continent of Genum was in a state of panic. No one knew what was happening or why the sky had turned orange. Some people were saying that it was a sign from the gods and that the world was going to end. Others were say that it was an attack from a rival continent. No one knew for sure, but the one thing everyone could agree on was that it was a terrifying sight.
