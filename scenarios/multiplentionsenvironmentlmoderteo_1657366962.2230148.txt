The leaders of multiple nations are gathered together to discuss a recent string of natural disasters that have been wreaking havoc on their countries. Earthquakes, floods, and wildfires have been decimating crops and infrastructure, and the death toll is rising. The situation is dire, and the leaders are struggling to come up with a solution. They are all in agreement that something needs to be done, but they cannot agree on what that something is. Tempers are running high, and the situation is quickly spiraling out of control. The leaders are finally able to come to a consensus, and they decide to send a team of scientists to investigate the cause of the disasters. The scientists discover that the disasters are being caused by a massive build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. They warn the leaders that unless something is done to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases being released, the situation is only going to get worse. The leaders are now faced with a difficult decision. They can either take measures to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases being released, or they can continue to sit idly by and watch as their countries are ravaged by natural disasters.
