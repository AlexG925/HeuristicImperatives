Jim is a 35-year-old man who lives alone in a small apartment. He works as a graphic designer for a local advertising agency. His work is not very demanding, and he is able to keep up with his rent and other expenses without much difficulty. However, Jim has a gambling problem. Every month, he sets aside a small amount of money to gamble with at the casino. This money is not enough to cover his expenses if he loses, but it is enough to give him a chance to win big. Unfortunately, Jim almost always loses. This causes him to fall behind on his rent and other bills. Jim has tried to stop gambling, but he always ends up back at the casino. This month, he has run out of money and is struggling to pay his rent. He is considering borrowing money from his friends or family, but he is embarrassed and does not want to admit his problem.
