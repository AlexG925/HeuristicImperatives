It was a warm autumn day, and the leaves were just starting to turn. James was out for a walk, enjoying the fresh air and the peace and quiet. Suddenly, he heard a loud crashing noise. It sounded like it was coming from the direction of his house. He started to run, and as he got closer, he could see that a large tree had fallen across the front of his house. There was no way to get around it. James was relieved that the tree had missed the house, but he was worried about what he was going to do about the tree. He didn't have any money to pay for a tree service, and he didn't want to try to remove the tree himself. He was going to have to wait for a while and hope that someone would come along and help him.
