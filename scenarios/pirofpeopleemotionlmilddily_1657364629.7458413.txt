It was a little after 9:00 a.m. when Samantha finally woke up. She lazily got out of bed, feeling like she had slept for days. It was Wednesday, which meant that she had to get ready for work. She looked over at her alarm clock and cursing, she realized that she had overslept again. She silently made a vow to herself that she would wake up on time from now on. She quickly got dressed and grabbed her purse, keys, and phone. She was about to head out the door when she realized that she had forgotten to eat breakfast. She quickly made herself a piece of toast and ran out the door. As she was driving to work, she received a phone call from her boss. He told her that she was being let go. She was in disbelief as she listened to him tell her that she wasn't meeting the company's expectations. Samantha tried to argue with him, but he was firm in his decision. Samantha hung up the phone, feeling like her world had just been turned upside down. She pulled over to the side of the road, trying to process what had just happened. She had been working at the company for years and she was one of the top performers. She didn't know what she was going to do now. Samantha sat in her car for a few minutes, trying to calm down. She knew that she needed to get to work, but she didn't know how she was going to face her co-workers. She took a deep breath and started driving again. When she got to work, she was relieved to see that her boss wasn't there. She went to her desk and started to pack up her things. She knew that she didn't have much time before he would be back, so she wanted to get out of there as soon as possible. A few minutes later, her boss walked in with another man. Samantha assumed that he was the HR manager. He told her to pack her things and leave immediately. He said that they would send her final paycheck in the mail. Samantha was in shock as she walked out of the building. She couldn't believe that she had been fired. She had no idea what she was going to do now.
