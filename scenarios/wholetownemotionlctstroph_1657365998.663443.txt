The townspeople of Rocksville had always been a close-knit group. They looked out for one another and support each other through thick and thin. So when the storm hit, they were all in it together. For three days, the rain came down in sheets, flooding the streets and homes. Many people were forced to evacuate to the local school, which was quickly turned into a makeshift shelter. supplies were running low and tempers were flaring. Then, on the fourth day, the rain stopped as suddenly as it had started. But the damage had been done. The town was a mess. Homes and businesses had been destroyed, and families were displaced. It would take months, maybe even years, to rebuild. But the townspeople were determined to do it. Together, they would come back stronger than ever.
