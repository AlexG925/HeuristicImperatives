In the middle of the night, a massive earthquake rocks the entire globe. The earthquake is so powerful that it topples buildings, creates massive cracks in the ground, and triggers deadly tsunamis. Nations all over the world are caught off guard and are struggling to cope with the devastation. Many countries are unable to provide adequate aid to their citizens and are facing widespread panic and chaos. The situation is made even worse by the fact that the earthquake has caused seismic activity that is still ongoing, making it difficult for rescue efforts to take place. The earthquake has also caused a number of volcanoes to erupt, adding to the destruction. So far, there has been no word from any international organization on how to deal with the situation.
