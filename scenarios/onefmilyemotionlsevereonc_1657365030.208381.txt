The family had been planning their trip for months. They were all packed and ready to go when the phone rang. It was the school district calling to say that their six year old had been expelled. The reason given was that the child had been disruptive in class and had not been following the rules. The child's parents were devastated. They had no idea what to do. They didn't want to leave their child behind, but they also didn't want to cancel their trip. In the end, they decided to go on the trip and leave their child with a babysitter. The family returned from their trip to find that their child had run away. They were frantic with worry. They searched the neighborhood and put up flyers, but there was no sign of the child. They were devastated. They had no idea what to do or where to turn. The situation was totally unresolved.
