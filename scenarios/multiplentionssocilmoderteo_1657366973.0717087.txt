In the early hours of the morning, a small band of rebels from the neighboring nation of Zumundi infiltrated the capital city of Dumosa. The rebel group quickly took control of the city's main square and proclaimed a revolution. The Dumosan government sent in the military to quell the uprising, but the rebels were prepared and fought back fiercely. After a day of heavy fighting, the rebels had taken control of half the city. The UN Security Council met to discuss the situation and called for an immediate ceasefire. They also urged the Dumosan government to negotiate with the rebels and find a peaceful resolution to the conflict. However, the Dumosan government refused to negotiate, and the fighting continued. After weeks of heavy fighting, the rebels finally managed to take control of the entire city. The Dumosan government fled the capital, and the rebels proclaimed themselves the new rulers of Dumosa. However, the rest of the country remained under Dumosan control. The UN Security Council met again to discuss the situation. They called for a peacekeeping force to be sent to Dumosa to help maintain order and protect civilians. They also urged the Dumosan government to begin negotiations with the rebels to try to reach a political settlement. However, the Dumosan government refused to negotiate, and the fighting continues.
