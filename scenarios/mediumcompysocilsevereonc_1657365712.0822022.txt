At Medium Inc., it's the annual company-wide meeting and there's a lot on the agenda. The mood in the room is tense as the CEO begins to speak. She starts by talking about the great work everyone has done over the past year, but quickly turns to the topic of the recent data leak. There are gasps around the room as she explains that the leaked information includes employee Social Security numbers, birthdates, and addresses. The CEO assures everyone that the investigation is ongoing and that they are taking steps to prevent something like this from happening again. The meeting ends with a Q&A session, during which no one seems to have any answers. Employees are visibly shaken and concerned for their safety and the security of their personal information. It's clear that this is a serious situation that has yet to be resolved.
