A recent string of robberies has the city on edge. For the past month, there has been at least one robbery every week, and the police have yet to catch the culprit. The citizens are on edge, and many are considering leaving the city altogether. The mayor is under pressure to find a solution, but so far nothing has worked. The police have increased patrols and set up a task force to try to catch the robbers, but to no avail. The robberies are taking a toll on the city's economy, as businesses are losing money and people are afraid to go out. The mayor is desperate to find a solution, but it seems like the city is at a loss.
