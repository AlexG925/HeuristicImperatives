The Johnson family had always been close, but when their youngest daughter was diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of cancer, they were brought even closer together. The family spent months by her bedside, taking turns sleeping in the hospital waiting room, doing whatever they could to support her. But when their daughter passed away, the family began to unravel. The oldest son blamed his parents for not doing more, the youngest blamed herself, and the parents were consumed by grief. The family stopped talking to each other, stopped going to family gatherings, and stopped celebrating holidays. It was as if their daughter's death had created a rift that could never be repaired.
