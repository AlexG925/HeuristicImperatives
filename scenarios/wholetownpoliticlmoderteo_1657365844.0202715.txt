The town of Centerville is a small, close-knit community. The town is home to a variety of businesses and a vibrant downtown area. However, the town is also home to a number of political factions. The two main political factions in Centerville are the Progressives and the Conservatives. The Progressives are a group of people who believe that the town should be moving forward and that change is necessary. They are often at odds with the Conservatives, who believe that the town should stay the same. The two groups often butt heads on various issues, but the situation usually remains calm. However, there have been a few instances where things have gotten out of hand. Most recently, the two groups have been arguing over a proposed ordinance that would require all businesses in the town to close on Sundays. The Progressives believe that this would be a good way to give people a break from work and allow them to spend time with their families. The Conservatives believe that this would be a burden on businesses and would lead to job losses. The situation has led to a moderate amount of commotion in the town, with each side holding rallies and protests. However, the situation has not yet been resolved and it remains to be seen what will happen next.
