The state of California is in the midst of a large and violent political upheaval. The once- peaceful and prosperous state has been divided into two factions: the pro-business and pro-government factions. The two factions have been fighting for control of the state for years, and the situation has finally come to a head. The pro-business faction has taken control of the state government, and the pro-government faction has taken control of the state's military. The two factions are now engaged in a brutal civil war, and the state is in chaos. Hundreds of people have been killed, and the state is on the brink of economic collapse. The situation is completely unresolved, and it is unclear what the future of California will be.
