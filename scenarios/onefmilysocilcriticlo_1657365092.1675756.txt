When the Cataclysm struck, the old world ended and a new one began. The Applegates were one of the first families to be caught in the crossfire. Their patriarch, Andrew, was a well-known politician who had been vocal in his opposition to the Cataclysm. As a result, when the Cataclysm hit, the Applegates were targeted. Their home was destroyed, their possessions were taken, and their lives were turned upside down. The family was forced to flee their home and take refuge in the wilderness.
