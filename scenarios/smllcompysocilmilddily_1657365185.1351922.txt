The break room at SprocketCo is always abuzz with activity. This morning is no different, as employees mill about, chatting and enjoying their coffee. Among them is Jane, who's new to the company. She's eager to make friends and fit in, so she strikes up a conversation with her co-workers. Eventually, the topic of conversation turns to the company's upcoming holiday party. Jane is excited to attend, but her co-workers seem less than enthusiastic. Some of them complain that the party is always the same - boring and awkward. Others say they don't like the forced socializing. Jane is a bit taken aback by their negative attitudes. The party is still a few weeks away, but Jane can't help but worry that it won't be as fun as she's hoping.
