Two people, A and B, are in a relationship. They're both happy with each other and they love spending time together. However, they also have their own careers and commitments. A is a doctor and B is a lawyer. They both work long hours and they don't always have time for each other. One day, they decide to try and use technology to help them connect with each other more. They set up a video chat so they can see each other during their lunch break, and they start sending each other cute little text messages and emojis throughout the day. It's a small thing, but it helps them feel closer to each other. Even though they're both busy, they know that they're still thinking of each other.
