At the weekly company meeting, the employees are discussing a recent commotion. It seems that one of the employees, Sarah, has been having some personal issues and has been taking them out on her co-workers. Last week, she had a huge fight with her husband and came into work extremely angry. She started yelling at her co-workers and throwing things around the office. This caused a lot of stress for everyone and they are not sure how to deal with her. Sarah's co-workers are divided on how to handle the situation. Some of them think that they should confront her and try to talk to her about her problems. Others think that it is best to just ignore her and hope that she will eventually calm down. No one is sure what to do, but they all agree that something needs to be done before Sarah starts hurting herself or someone else.
