John was in his usual morning routine, getting dressed for work and thinking about what he needed to do that day. As he went to put his wallet in his pocket, he realized he had left it on the dresser from the night before. He rummaged through his pockets for any loose change he could find, but came up empty. He knew he couldn't go to work without any money, so he decided to go to the nearest ATM and withdraw some cash. When he got to the ATM, he inserted his card and punched in his PIN. The machine beeped and an error message popped up on the screen. John cursed under his breath- he had forgotten to transfer money into his checking account from his savings account the day before. He didn't have enough money to cover the withdrawal. John was frustrated and angry as he walked back to his apartment. He didn't know what he was going to do. He couldn't go to work without any money, but he also didn't have enough money to transfer into his checking account. He decided to call his boss and ask for a advance on his paycheck, but his boss said no. John was stuck.
