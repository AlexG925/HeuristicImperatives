A severe once-in-a-year uproar has engulfed the world. The situation began when a group of militants attacked a key government building in a small country. This act of violence set off a chain reaction, with other groups in other countries taking up arms against their own government. The violence has spread quickly, and it appears that the world is on the brink of all-out war. The governments of the world are struggling to contain the violence, but so far they have been unable to do so. The militaries of the major powers are on high alert, and the people of the world are living in fear. It is unclear what will happen next, but it seems likely that the situation will continue to deteriorate.
