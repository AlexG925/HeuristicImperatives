A young woman, a recent college graduate, is working in her first job as a legislative aide. She's had the job for about a year, and she's starting to get frustrated with the lack of progress that her boss, a state senator, is making. She's also starting to get tired of the senator's constant demands and the long hours she's expected to work. One day, after a particularly frustrating day at work, she comes home and finds her boyfriend packing his things. He tells her that he's moving out, and he can't take it anymore. She's stunned and heartbroken, and she can't imagine going back to work the next day.
