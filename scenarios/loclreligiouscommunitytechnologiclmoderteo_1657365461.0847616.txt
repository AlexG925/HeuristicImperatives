Every month, on the night of the full moon, the local religious community gathers for a ritual. They light candles and Incense, and chant for hours. The disturbance usually lasts for about an hour, and then everything goes back to normal. The situation is unresolved, and the community has no idea what to do about it. The ritual started about a year ago, when the community's priest had a vision. He claimed that the goddess was speaking to him, and that she demanded that the community offer her a monthly sacrifice. The priest chose the full moon as the time for the ritual, and the community has been doing it ever since. The ritual has taken a toll on the community. Many of them are tired and frustrated, and some have even started to question their faith. The priest is starting to lose hope, and he doesn't know what to do.
