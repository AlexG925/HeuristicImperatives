The European Union is in an uproar. Every year, on the first of July, the nations of the EU come together to discuss their impending financial crisis. This year, however, the crisis is much worse than anticipated. Several countries are on the verge of bankruptcy, and the only way to save the EU is to take drastic measures. These measures include: -Imposing severe austerity measures on all member states -Formally declaring bankruptcy -Dissolving the EU and re-establishing it as a smaller, more manageable organization The first two options are highly unpopular, and so the majority of the member states vote to dissolve the EU. This decision is not without its detractors, however, and so the process of dissolving the EU is fraught with difficulty. In the end, the EU is dissolved, but its member states are left in an even worse financial situation than before.
