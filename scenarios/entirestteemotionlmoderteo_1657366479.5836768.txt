The state is in a panic as a large group of bandits have been terrorizing the countryside. Towns have been burned, crops destroyed, and innocent people have been killed. The king has called on all able-bodied men to take up arms and defend the realm, but so far they have been unsuccessful in stopping the band of marauders. The people are living in fear, not knowing when or where the bandits will strike next.
