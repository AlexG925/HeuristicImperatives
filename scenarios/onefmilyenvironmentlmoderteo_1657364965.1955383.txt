The Johnson family was sitting in their living room watching the news when they heard a loud bang outside. They went to the window to see what was going on and saw their neighbor's house on fire. The family quickly ran outside to see if they could help, but the fire was too out of control. They called the fire department and watched as the house was consumed by the flames. The family was devastated and couldn't believe this was happening. They were so thankful that their own home was spared, but they couldn't help but feel for their neighbors.
