The Johnson family had just finished dinner and were sitting down to watch a movie when they heard a loud crash outside. They went to investigate and saw that a large tree had fallen in their front yard, narrowly missing their house. They were thankful that no one was hurt, but now they had to figure out what to do with the tree. They couldn't just leave it there, but they didn't have the money to pay for someone to remove it. They decided to call a few friends and see if anyone could help them. After an hour of trying, they finally got the tree removed and were able to go back inside and watch their movie.
