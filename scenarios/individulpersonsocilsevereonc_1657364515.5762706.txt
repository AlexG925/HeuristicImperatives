John was having a great day. He woke up early, went for a run, and then made himself a healthy breakfast. He had a busy day ahead, but he was looking forward to it. Around lunchtime, John got a call from his boss. His boss was screaming at him, and John couldn't understand what he was saying. John tried to explain that he didn't know what was going on, but his boss just yelled at him again. Finally, John hung up the phone and went back to work, feeling confused and worried. John's boss called him into his office a few hours later. John's boss was still very angry, and he blamed John for the whole situation. John tried to explain again that he didn't know what was going on, but his boss wasn't listening. John was fired on the spot. John was in shock as he walked out of his boss's office. He had no idea what he was going to do now. He was about to lose his job, and he didn't know how he was going to support himself or his family. John was feeling scared and alone as he left the building.
