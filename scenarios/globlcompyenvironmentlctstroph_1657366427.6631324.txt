In the early hours of the morning, the CEO of a large global company is informed of a massive environmental disaster. A huge oil spill has occurred in the company's key manufacturing region, causing widespread panic and confusion. The CEO quickly mobilizes the company's resources to try to contain the spill and mitigate the damage. However, the spill is far larger than anticipated, and the company's efforts are quickly overwhelmed. As the days go by, the spill grows larger and larger, ultimately reaching a size that is several times larger than the company's initial estimate. The resulting environmental damage is catastrophic, and the company is forced to declare bankruptcy. The CEO and other top executives are arrested and charged with negligence. The company'sassets are auctioned off to pay for the cleanup cost, leaving the company's employees and shareholders with nothing.
