A whole town was in an uproar. It was a Tuesday morning and the streets were bustling with people running errands and going to work. The shops were open, but the prices of goods had quadrupled overnight. No one could explain why. Then, in the early afternoon, a strange man came to town. He was heavily cloaked and wore a hood that obscured his face. He went to the town square and climbed atop a fountain. Then he spoke in a booming voice. "People of this town! I have come to take over! All your possessions now belong to me! You will work for me or suffer my wrath!" The people were terrified. They had no idea what to do. The man just laughed and then teleported away.
