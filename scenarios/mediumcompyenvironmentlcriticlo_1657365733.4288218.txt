A freak winter storm causes widespread damage and power outages across the state, leaving tens of thousands of people without heat or power for days. The storm cuts off access to many roads and businesses, and communication is difficult. This causes a lot of hardship for small businesses and families, who have to scramble to find food, water, and shelter. Many people are forced to leave their homes and businesses and stay with friends or family. The state government declares a state of emergency and mobilizes resources to help the people affected by the storm. The National Guard is called in to help with rescue and relief efforts. The storm causes billions of dollars in damage and takes weeks to clean up. This is a major setback for the state, and it will take years to recover.
