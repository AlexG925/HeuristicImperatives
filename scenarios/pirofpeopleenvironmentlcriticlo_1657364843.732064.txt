Frank and his wife Ada were out for a leisurely stroll on a Sunday morning when they suddenly heard a loud rumble. They looked up in time to see a huge wall of water bearing down on them. Frank grabbed Ada and they ran as fast as they could, but they were swept away by the deluge. When they finally managed to struggle to the surface, they found themselves in the middle of a vast wasteland. There was nothing left of their home or their town â€“ only debris and ruin as far as the eye could see. They are now struggling to survive in this hostile new environment, and the future looks very uncertain.
