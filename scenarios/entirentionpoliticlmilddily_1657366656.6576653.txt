All was not well in the land of Freedonia. The once great nation was in a state of disarray, with fighting in the streets and no end in sight. The people were tired of the same old politicians, and were demanding change. But the establishment was not about to let go of power so easily. In an attempt to quell the unrest, the government imposed a curfew and began rounding up dissenters. This only served to inflame the situation, and soon the entire country was in chaos. The situation remains unresolved, and the future of Freedonia hangs in the balance.
