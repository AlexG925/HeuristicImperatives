The Smith family live in a comfortable house in the suburbs. However, every Wednesday night, at precisely 8pm, their house is invaded by a large, unidentified creature. The creature trashes the place, tearing up furniture and leaving a mess everywhere. The family has tried everything to get rid of the creature, but nothing has worked. They've even contacted the police, but they haven't been able to find the creature either. The family has grown used to the Wednesday night visits, and they've started to just clean up the mess afterwards. But they still don't know what the creature is or why it keeps coming back.
