In their small two-bedroom apartment, bills and papers were strewn about the coffee table. It was Monday morning and both John and Jane were getting ready for work. "I can't believe we're already out of money," said Jane as she picked up a bill. "The rent is due tomorrow and we don't have enough to cover it." "I know," said John. "I got paid today, so I'll go to the ATM and see if I can withdraw some extra cash." "Okay," said Jane. "I'll call the landlord and see if they'll give us an extension." With their minds on their finances, John and Jane left for work. Their small emergency fund had been depleted and they were now relying on credit cards to get by. Things were getting tight and they didn't know how much longer they could keep up with their bills.
