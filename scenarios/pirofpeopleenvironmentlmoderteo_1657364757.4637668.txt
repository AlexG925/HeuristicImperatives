Janie and John had been planning their weekend getaway for months. They were both excited to finally have some time off from work and spend some time together. They had rented a cabin in the woods and were looking forward to hiking and being in nature. However, when they arrived at the cabin, they found that it was in disarray. It looked like someone had broken in and ransacked the place. They found broken glass everywhere and their belongings were strewn about the cabin. Janie and John were both shaken by the incident and didn't know what to do. They eventually decided to call the police and wait for them to arrive. They were both terrified and didn't know what to expect.
