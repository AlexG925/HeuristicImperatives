Every Wednesday, for the past month, the state of Indiana has been hit with a strange phenomenon. A dense fog descends upon the entire state, blanketing it in a eerie white mist. Visibility is reduced to mere feet, and the fog is so thick that it feels like one could reach out and touch it. This fog is more than just an annoyance; it's been interfering with daily life. Air travel has come to a standstill, as planes are unable to take off or land in the fog. Commuters are stranded on highways, unable to see more than a few feet in front of them. And schools have been forced to close, as children cannot safely walk to class in the thick mist. So far, no one has been able to explain the phenomenon. The National Weather Service has issued statements saying that they are working with experts to try to determine the cause of the fog, but so far no one has been able to provide a definitive answer. In the meantime, life in Indiana has been thrown into disarray, and no one knows when the fog will finally lift.
