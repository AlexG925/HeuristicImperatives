Izzy and Jake are sitting in a coffee shop, people watching. Jake is trying to figure out the perfect way to ask Izzy out, and Izzy is absently scrolling through social media on her phone. Suddenly, they both hear a commotion outside. They look out the window and see a group of people running and screaming. A few people are even holding up their phones and recording the scene. Izzy and Jake both stand up and start to head towards the door, but then they hear another commotion. This time it's coming from the other side of the coffee shop. They turn around and see a group of people running towards them, screaming and knocking over tables and chairs. Jake grabs Izzy's hand and they start to run towards the back of the coffee shop. They make it to the back room and Jake pushes open the door that leads to the alley. They start to run down the alley, but they hear someone coming after them. Jake looks back and sees a man with a gun. He starts to shoot at them and they duck down behind a dumpster. Jake pulls out his own gun and returning fire. The man seems to be getting closer and Jake knows they can't stay there. He looks at Izzy and she nods. They start to run again. They make it to the end of the alley and Jake pushes open the door that leads to the street. They start to run, but they hear the man coming after them again. Jake looks back and sees that the man is gaining on them. He knows they can't outrun him. He takes a deep breath and prepares to make a stand.
