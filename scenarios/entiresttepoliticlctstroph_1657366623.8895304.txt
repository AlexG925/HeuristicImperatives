In the year 20xx, the state of California was beset by a series of natural disasters. The first was a massive earthquake that struck the southern part of the state, followed by a series of wildfires that swept through the northern part of the state. This left the state in a state of emergency, with the government struggling to provide basic services to the people. The situation was made worse by the fact that the state was also hit by a financial crisis, with the state's debt reaching unsustainable levels. This led to a series of protests and riots, and the situation remains unresolved.
