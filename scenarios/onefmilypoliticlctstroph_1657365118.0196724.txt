The year is 2049 and the world is in a state of pandemonium. A once-in-a-century pandemic has struck, decimating entire populations and leaving millions of people homeless and starving. In the midst of this crisis, one family has managed to maintain their grip on power. The patriarch of the family, Victor, is the President of the United States. His wife, Elena, is the Speaker of the House. Their children, Sasha and Dmitri, are both prominent members of the government. The family has used their position to amass a vast fortune, and they now live in a luxurious compound, surrounded by armed guards. They are completely cut off from the outside world, and they have everything they could possibly want. But they are not content. They want more power, and they will stop at nothing to get it. The family is ruthless in their quest for power, and they have made enemies all over the world. They are constantly at war with other nations, and they are always looking for new ways to increase their influence. They are paranoid, and they suspect that everyone is out to get them. They are always on the lookout for any sign of dissent, and they are quick to crush any opposition. The family is hated by many, but they remain in power. They are a symbol of everything that is wrong with the world, and they seem to be unstoppable. But there are those who are plotting to end their reign. They are waiting for the right moment to strike, and they will not rest until the family is destroyed.
