The McDonough Corporation is a medium-sized company that manufactures parts for cars. Every year, the company holds a major shareholders' meeting to discuss the company's performance and plans for the future. This year, the meeting was marked by a severe uproar. Several shareholders demanded to know why the company's profits had been declining for the past year. The CEO, Mr. McDonough, explained that the decline was due to increased competition from foreign manufacturers. He promised that the company would invest more in research and development to regain its competitive edge. This answer angered some of the shareholders, who accused the CEO of being out of touch with reality. They argued that the company needed to cut costs and improve efficiency in order to compete with the foreign manufacturers. The meeting quickly descended into chaos, with shouting and name-calling on both sides. The situation remains unresolved, with the shareholders and the CEO both digging in their heels. It is unclear what will happen at next year's shareholders' meeting, but it is sure to be another heated affair.
