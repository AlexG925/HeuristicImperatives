It was 8:00 a.m. when I woke up from the sound of my alarm. I lazily got out of bed, feeling like I had slept for days. I switched off my alarm and silently made my way to the living room, where I found my mother and sister watching tv. We exchanged brief conversation and soon enough I was out the door, caught up in the morning crowd. I was one of the lucky ones, I thought, when I saw the sidewalk completely covered in snow. I loved the winter. As I watched the snowflakes lazily fall through the air, I wanted to grab one.
