The employees of the small company huddle around the break room table, laughing and joking as they eat their lunch. It's a typical day at the office, with the usual mild hubbub. But today, there's an added layer of tension in the air. The employees can feel it, but no one knows quite what to say. Suddenly, the door to the break room opens and the boss walks in. He looks around at the employees, then clears his throat to get their attention. "I've got some bad news," he says. "I'm sorry to say that we're going to have to let some of you go." There are gasps and murmurs from the employees. No one knows who will be chosen, but everyone is afraid they will be next. The boss looks around the room, his eyes landing on each employee in turn. "I'm sorry," he says again. "But we just can't afford to keep all of you on." With that, he turns and walks out of the room, leaving the employees to their own devices. There is a long moment of silence, broken only by the sound of someone softly crying in the corner.
