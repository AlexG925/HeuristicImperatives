In 2030, Global Communications Corporation (GCC) is the world’s leading telecommunications company. They provide service to over 3 billion customers in more than 200 countries.Their products and services include mobile phones, broadband Internet, TV, satellite, and fixed-line telephone services. GCC is headquartered in New York City, with regional offices in London, Paris, Dubai, and Johannesburg. Their customer service call center is located in Mumbai, India. Due to a new software update, GCC’s systems crash once a week, typically on Wednesdays at 3pm EST. This causes a major disruption to their service and leaves customers without service for several hours. The company is working on a fix, but has not been able to resolve the issue. In the meantime, they have implemented a contingency plan where customer service reps are available to answer calls and help troubleshoot problems.
