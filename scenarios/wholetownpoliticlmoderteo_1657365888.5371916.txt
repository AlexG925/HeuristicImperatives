One month, the town of Shepherdstown is disturbed by a whole host of oddities. The sky is orange, the sun is green, and the birds suddenly all fly north. The townspeople are baffled, and no one knows what to make of it. The only thing that seems to be certain is that something is definitely not right. The situation comes to a head when the mayor's daughter is kidnapped by a group of mysterious cloaked figures. The townspeople are terrified, and they demand that the mayor do something about it. However, the mayor is powerless to help, and the town is left to fend for itself. For the next few weeks, the town is in a state of flux. No one knows what to do, and the only thing that seems certain is that something needs to be done. However, no one can agree on what that something is, and so the town remains in a state of limbo, waiting for something to happen.
