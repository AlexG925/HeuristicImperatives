It was a warm autumn night and Alice and John were enjoying a romantic dinner together at their favorite restaurant. They had just finished their main course and were enjoying a lovely glass of wine when they heard a commotion from the kitchen. They could hear shouting and then a crash. It sounded like someone had broken something. Alice and John exchanged a worried look and then got up from their table to see what was going on. When they got to the kitchen, they saw that one of the cooks had dropped a tray of dishes and was now shouting at the other workers. The cook was red in the face and looked like he was about to boil over. The other workers were cowering in fear and no one was dare say a word. Alice and John exchanged another look and then stepped into the kitchen. John spoke first, trying to calm the cook down. But it was like the man was possessed. He just kept yelling and ranting. Finally, Alice had had enough. She stepped forward and slapped the cook across the face. It was like a switch had been flipped. The man stopped yelling and just stood there with a shocked look on his face. The other workers started to come out of their hiding spots and began to clean up the mess. Alice and John exchanged one more look and then went back to their table. They didn't speak for the rest of the meal, but they both knew that they had just witnessed something strange and troubling.
