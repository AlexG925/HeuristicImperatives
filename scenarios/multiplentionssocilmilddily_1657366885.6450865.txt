In the city of Rome, its a beautiful day. Pigeons coo in the plaza and a light breeze steadily blows through the air. In the distance, the looming outline of the Colosseum stands as a testament to the citys grandeur. Today, however, there is an unusual tension in the air. Tourists from all over the world mingle with the locals, but there is an undercurrent of suspicion and mistrust. This is because today is the day that representatives from all over the world are meeting in the city to discuss a new trade agreement. For weeks, the news has been full of stories about the potential for this agreement to benefit some countries more than others. There has been a lot of talk about who will be getting the better end of the deal, and now that the representatives are finally meeting, the tension in the air is thick. No one knows what will happen when the representatives start bargaining, but everyone is hopeful that a deal can be reached that will be beneficial for all involved. However, with so much mistrust and suspicion in the air, it may be difficult to reach a consensus.
