As soon as Rachel steps out of her car, she can tell that something is wrong. The air is still and oppressive, like the eye of a storm. And sure enough, within seconds the wind picks up and starts howling around her. Rachel tries to make her way to the front door of her house, but the wind is so strong that she can barely move. She's forced to crawl along the ground, clutching at the grass to keep from being blown away. Finally she makes it to the door and manages to get inside, but the wind is so strong that it blows the door right off its hinges. Rachel huddles on the floor, trying to make herself as small as possible and praying that the storm will pass quickly. But it seems like the wind is only getting stronger and stronger, and Rachel knows that she's in for a long night.
