The Johnson family are sitting in their living room watching TV when suddenly the power goes out. They hear a loud crash outside and see that a tree has fallen on their power lines. The family is left in the dark for the rest of the night. The next day, the Johnsons wake up to find that the power is still out. They try to call the power company, but their phone is also out. They decide to go to the store to buy some supplies, but when they get there they find that the store is closed. The Johnsons are now starting to get worried. They have no power, no phone, and no way to get supplies. They are forced to wait it out until the power comes back on. But the days start to turn into weeks, and the weeks turn into months. The power never comes back on, and the Johnson family is forced to live in the dark.
