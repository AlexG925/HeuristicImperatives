The world is on the brink of war. Multiple nations have been skirmishing with each other for years, but the recent death of a key diplomat has brought the situation to a head. The funeral of the diplomat was being held in a neutral country, but when the representatives of the various nations began to arrive, they quickly realized that they were all being parked in different sections of the country, far away from each other. It quickly became clear that this was not a mistake, but a deliberate attempt to keep the various nations apart. Tensions are running high, and it seems like it is only a matter of time before all-out war breaks out. The various nations are mobilizing their armies, and the diplomats are frantically trying to find a way to resolve the situation before it is too late.
