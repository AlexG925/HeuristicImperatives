One family's emotional scenario may be about a moderate once-in-a-week commotion that is unresolved. The father may be angry with the mother for something she did during the week and he explodes during dinner. The mother and father may start yelling at each other and the children are sitting in the middle of it all, trying to figure out what is going on. The commotion typically lasts for a few minutes and then everyone goes back to their normal routine, but the tension is still there.
