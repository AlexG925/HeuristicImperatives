It was the day of the town's annual festival and everyone was in high spirits. The streets were lined with stalls and the smell of fresh, piping hot food filled the air. families and friends laughed and chatted as they wandered from one stall to the next, sampling the wares on offer. Suddenly, a loud commotion could be heard from the other end of the street. A group of men and women were shouting and waving placards, marching towards the center of town. As they got closer, it became clear that they were protesting the town's mayor. They were angry about the mayor's decision to raise taxes, and they felt that he was not listening to the people's needs. The protest quickly turned violent, with the police struggling to keep the crowds under control. The mayor's office was besieged by the protesters, and it was clear that this was not going to be a peaceful resolution.
