The fictional nation is called Umera. It is a small, isolated nation that is cut off from the rest of the world by a large mountain range. The only way into or out of Umera is by a small, treacherous pass through the mountains. For centuries, Umera has been a poverty-stricken country, its people barely scraping by on what little resources they have. But then, a miracle happens. A rich vein of gold is found in the mountain pass. Suddenly, Umera is flush with money. The goldrush attracts fortune seekers from all over the world, and the small nation is soon booming. But the newfound wealth doesn't last. The gold vein dries up, and the people of Umera are left with nothing. The economy collapses, and the once-great nation is reduced to a shadow of its former self.
