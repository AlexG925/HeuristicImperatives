John and Jane have been married for 5 years. They have a 2-year-old daughter named Lily. They both work full-time jobs and are very busy. They love each other, but they sometimes argue. Last night, John came home from work and Jane was in the kitchen cooking dinner. Lily was sitting at the table eating her dinner. John could tell that Jane was angry. He asked her what was wrong, but she refused to tell him. John was tired from work and didn't want to argue, so he went into the living room and watched TV. Jane came in a few minutes later and sat down next to him. They didn't say anything to each other. They just sat there silently, watching TV. After a while, Jane got up and went to bed. John stayed up for a while longer, then went to bed. The next morning, John woke up and Jane was already up and getting Lily ready for school. John asked her again what was wrong, but she still wouldn't tell him. She said she was fine and didn't want to talk about it. John was getting angry now. He told Jane that he was tired of her being angry all the time and not telling him what was wrong. He said he was going to go to work and he would be back later. Jane was angry and hurt. She didn't want to fight with John, but she didn't want to tell him what was wrong either. She was feeling overwhelmed and stressed out. She just wanted to be left alone. John left for work and Jane was left at home with Lily. She was feeling really bad now. She was regretting not telling John what was wrong. She was worried that he was going to be mad at her when he came home. Jane decided to call John and tell him what was wrong. She apologized for not telling him earlier and they both agreed to talk about it when he got home.
