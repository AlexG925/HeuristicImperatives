The state of California is in the midst of a massive social upheaval. For the past 10 years, the state has been dealing with a severe drought, and the resulting water shortages have led to widespread panic and rioting. The state government has declared a state of emergency, and the National Guard has been called in to restore order. However, the situation remains unresolved, and the people of California are living in fear of what the future holds.
