A small company is in the middle of a commotion. One of the employees, who is also the company's only environmental specialist, has discovered that the company's waste disposal practices are causing serious environmental damage. The employee has tried to raise the issue with the company's management, but they have refused to listen. The employee is now threatening to go public with the information unless the company makes changes. The company is in a dilemma. They don't want to damage their reputation, but they also don't want to make the changes that the employee is demanding.
